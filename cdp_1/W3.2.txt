Substantive change is defined as any event that would cause significant interruption of product flow to our customers in any of the global markets that we serve.   While water is a key resource for manufacturing, the company is not exposed to significant physical risks at a global level. Risks associated with water to any single manufacturing site or locale could have a significant local impact; however, operating contingencies and geographic diversification limit these risks to Abbott's business, operations, revenue and expenditures.
Substantive change would mean either the inability to operate one of our facilities due to conditions of flooding, drought, inability to meet environmental regulations, unacceptable compliance cost or significant changes to fiber supply.

Several Allergan  locations have experienced droughts in the past 20 years with the most recent occurring between 2007 and 2010 and currently in 2013 (areas include California, Texas and Brazil).  Water is delivered into the areas from several other locations to supplement the demand from the area.  Reuse of treated effluent to supplement existing groundwater resources has been instituted over the past four years in southern California.  Plans for mandatory water curtailment and water rationing were developed for these sites.  Water costs continue to climb as the resource becomes more restricted.  There have been no impacts to Allergan product manufacturing nor revenues as a result of these droughts to date.  The water cost increases have been minimal when compared to other utility costs such as electricity and fuel.  However, in Brazil, electricity is tied to water availability due to the high reliance on hydroelectric power in the country.  Droughts in Brazil do impact the electrical costs as well as the water costs, and are therefore more substantial.
Seasonal rainfall fluctuations may affect the volume and quality of crop production on farms within our supply chain.  We judge the risk to our business as low at this time due to our flexibility to source from other origins.A substantive change would require alternative sourcing from other locations and we have proven global supply chains to deliver this flexibility.

Altria’s operating companies are exposed to some water-related risks (current or future) but at this time we do not believe these risks have the potential to generate a substantive change in our business operation, revenue or expenditure. Altria publically discloses risks that could adversely impact the operations, sales, profitability and business of an affected subsidiary in a material way.Altria's operating company, Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, operates one production facility that is located in a water-stressed area as defined by the WBCSD Global Water Tool: WRI Annual Renewable Water Supply Per Person (projections for 2025). Ste. Michelle operates 11 production facilities across three states and the operating company accounted for 2.6% of Altria's revenues in 2014.
At the current time, there are no identified current or future risks that have a material impact on business operations. Our efforts in understanding potential water risks at the corporate level or with our supply chain is continuing to evolve. We will continue to develop this process through the use of water risk tools (like WBCSD or GEMI), increased engagement with our local water agencies, and focus on improving water use and conservation.Substantive change in our business operations would be defined as having a material impact on the company related to increased spending in our internal operations or one that results in significant changes for our suppliers.

Potable water is a necessary resource to our manufacturing process. Should water become extremelyscarce in regions where we manufacture our products, it could potentially have an impact on our manufacturing operations. This potential risk has been identified at a functional level within Environment, Health, Safety, and Sustainability and is considered a low potential risk.
A substantive change is a significant modification or expansion in the scope or nature of Anadarko’s direct operations (not suppliers) at a field level, as measured by the level of activity or production of an asset from sourcing, management or disposal of water. Anadarko has a deep portfolio of opportunities in the U.S. onshore, most of which would be considered unconventional resources plays. As such, these assets require access to water for drilling and completions operations. Without an adequate supply of water, Anadarko and/or its suppliers would need to develop alternatives, allocate capital to other assets in its portfolio, and/or consider reducing the level of activity in a given play. The threshold amount of change necessary will differ among operational plays based upon the economics involved with the required change. These considerations are a significant part of our investment, engagement and water-management strategies to ensure adequate supplies of and appropriate disposal of water at all of our U.S. onshore growth opportunities. Additionally, activity levels are evaluated continuously as part of our budget process for each field. During the budget process, potential changes in operations and costs, including water availability, management and disposal, are considered.
For exploration, a substantive change is defined as any change that reduces the rate of return below the threshold that prevents the project from occurring.  In terms of a producing well, a substantive change would increase the operating expense or lower production (i.e. if waterflood was prohibited) to the point that margins are no longer sufficient to continue production.
We rate our risk based on a measure of probability versus severity. A substantial ("substantive change") risk would be one that: - has a high level of probability, meaning most key factors contributing to the risk are present.  There may be deficiencies in controls or procedures currently in place.  Historically, the event has occurred with some frequency within Aptar or the industry.  The event is considered likely to occur once every 1-5 years.- has a high level of severity, meaning the potential impact on cash flow and earnings is material and will directly impact Aptar’s ability to meet strategic business objectives.  Quantified as impacts of $10 million or more.We rank probability and severity from 0 (low) - 10 (high). Per this rating sytem, items falling in the following catagories would require mitigation plans and are assigned an owner accountable for corrective action. These would be considered "red zone" items:-has severity 3.5 - 6.5 and probability of 6.5 or greater;-has probability of 3.5 - 6.5 and severity of 6.5 or greater;-or has a severity and a probability of greater than 6.5

AVY defines substantive change as impacts on revenue, stakeholders and costs as well as availability of purchased goods. Indicators and amount of these changes we recognize as substantive changes include 5% revenue, concerns expressed by key stakeholders, and cost increases as much as 5% (or significant risk of material availability). Any one of these elements or a combination thereof would be basis for evaluating mitigating measures. These elements impact both direct operations and supply chain.

In terms of water risk, Baker Hughes defines a substantive change as one that has a material impact (positive or negative) upon our potential for revenue generation, and results in significant changes to the way we conduct our operations and/or to internal systems of control. The impacts may be direct (e.g., a hurricane damaging Baker Hughes assets, and disrupting operations), or indirect (e.g., through an impact on client activity, which affects our potential to gain or maintain business). Such changes would be disclosed in our annual financial report.For the purposes of reporting to Water CDP, Baker Hughes focused on global facilities operating in water stressed areas deemed Extreme or High according to the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas.  Additionally, facilities operating in the United States that were categorized as Medium-High water risk were evaluated.  All areas were analyzed based on any substantive change to Global Revenue.  Many of the facilities found to be in water stressed areas did not have supply chain operations, so only those with direct operations were included.  Within the United States, an emphasis was placed on water stressed areas that would have a greater impact on revenues due to their location on shale plays.
For the purpose of CDP reporting, we consider risks that have potential financial implications of $10 million or more for our direct operations or our supply chain to be substantive.

Mining operations generally requires years of exploration, engineering design, environmental impact study, permit application and construction to be developed. Once constructed, every operation follows a life of mine (LOM) plan that schedule the annual production rate, waste management and environmental remediation etc. from operation to closure and post closure. We consider a wide range of risk factors in our corporate level risk monitoring and assessment.  For the purpose of this 2014 CDP report any long-term or medium-term deviation with a magnitude of greater than $200 M cash flow impact or 10% of the LOM key parameters, such as production rate, waste management, and increase in capital/operational cost etc., will be considered substantive change.  This definition has resulted in the removal of several risks that were reported last year.  We still account for these risks and many more water related risks but those are not discussed per definition. We repeat our water risk assessment on an annual basis. As part of this exercise, in 2015, the risk thresholds will be reviewed in light of developments in the business to ensure they are meaningful, and amended as appropriate.

Water risks are considered as part of business continuity planning.  Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency & distribution of storms.  While any one weather event is not tied to climate change, BD is experiencing weather impacts on its operations, including some site closures as a result of severe weather. We have manufacturing sites all over the world. In some instances, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. Weather, natural disasters (including pandemics), political change, failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products, resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customersClimate change is predicted to increase droughts in certain regions that are dependent on hydropower or in areas where high quality water is required for operations. We have already seen some price increases in areas such as Brazil.  This may increase the cost of electricity if low water reservoirs require switching to another form of energy that is more expensive.  Additionally, water costs may increase in certain areas if droughts are prolonged and/or severe.

At Best Buy, we use an ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System (EMS) in our U.S. operations to systematically identify, prioritize, manage and review environmental aspects. Through the use of our EMS, we are able to systematically assess and continuously improve our environmental initiatives, goals, compliance matters, and ultimately reduce our environmental impact.  Water was not categorized as a high priority because our water use per square foot is minimal. In our company-owned or managed facilities, water use is primarily limited to these fixture types: water closets, urinals, lavatory faucets and kitchen sinks. In most facilities, Best Buy is a tenant and water used for irrigation purposes is controlled and operated by the property owners. Our water is supplied and treated by local municipalities. As a retailer, our water impacts are de minimis. Through the use of our EMS, we ensure compliance with all regulatory frameworks regarding water—specifically storm water permits.In addition, in 2014 the Best Buy Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability team conducted a sustainability assessment. The assessment identified environmental and social topics based on analysis of interviews and surveys with internal business partners and key external stakeholders. Our analysis determined e-waste, climate change, responsible sourcing, and sustainable products are among the top sustainability priorities for our company. Water use in our operations is de minimis and not considered material.

A substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risks would be characterized by a disruption of a potable water supply substantial enough to warrant shutting down any aspect of our manufacturing process.  As our manufacturing process is highly regimented, delay at any stage due to a water shortage has the potential to require the entire batch to be discarded for quality and safety concerns. Additionally, some of our suppliers are under similar constraints and substantial shutdowns for them could impact our material supplies, thus restricting our operations.

We follow an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process that encompasses our entire company to identify, assess, prioritize and address major risks on an ongoing basis.  ERM addresses the full spectrum of risks: market/environmental, compliance, legal, strategic, financial/operational and reputational.  When a significant risk is identified based on internal financial thresholds and other criteria, the process includes the development, implementation and monitoring of risk mitigation strategies and reporting. Within ERM, we define Business Continuity Management as a holistic management process that identifies lower-probability significant events, including those resulting from climate change-related events such as the increased frequency or severity of weather conditions, including hurricanes, typhoons or tornados.The Audit Committee of our Board participates in regular reviews of our ERM process to assess and manage enterprise risks, including those related to market/environmental, strategic, financial, operational, legal, compliance and reputational risks. In addition, each of the other standing Board Committees regularly meet to discuss the short-term and long-term objectives and provide oversight for risks related to the applicable committee’s areas of responsibility.  As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight as part of its fiduciary duty of care to effectively monitor business operations. Our Board administers its risk oversight function as a whole and through its Committees.  The asset or operational responsibility for these areas is delegated to the senior executive level.
A disruption to business continuity resulting from a water-related risk could substantively change the business, operations, revenue and potential expenditures. The relative impact would likely be measured using environmental, human and/or economic metrics.

Brown-Forman evaluates many variables in determining substantive change of our business and operations. One such variable is the overall availability of water for use in our direct operations. Globally, our company faces some direct risk associated with water scarcity because of the location of our operations and the requirements for water in our production processes and finished products. This risk stems from constraints on the available quantity, quality, and cost of water supplies across our enterprise but especially from a minority of our operations located in certain sensitive areas.Furthermore, a number of our key ingredients are agricultural based and are also dependent upon the availability of water. Any change in water dynamics, including water stress or even flooding, could cause supply disruptions or alterations in our supplier arrangements. This would result in cost increases for Brown-Forman. Also within our supply chain, we utilize co-packers for final completion of products. These facilities, while outside our operational control, rely upon abundant amounts of high quality water to carry out their services. Any disruption to their operations could impact the production and delivery of products.Weather, the effects of climate change, diseases, and other agricultural uncertainties that affect the mortality, health, yield, quality, or price of the various raw materials used in our products also present risks for our business, including in some cases potential impairment in the recorded value of our inventory. Changes in weather patterns or intensity can substantively disrupt our supply chain as well, which may affect production operations, insurance costs and coverage, as well as the timely delivery of our products to customers.Water is one of the major components of our products, so the quality and quantity of available water is important to our ability to operate our business. If droughts become more common or severe, or if our water supply were interrupted for other reasons, high-quality water could become scarce in some key production regions for our products, including Tennessee, Kentucky, California, Finland, Canada, and Mexico.

While Bunge has not defined a numerical threshold for what constitutes a substantive risk related to water, material impacts to the company’s financial results may stem from three types of risk:Our sugar production depends on the volume and sucrose content of the sugarcane that we cultivate or that is supplied to us by third-party growers. Both sugarcane crop yields and sucrose content depend significantly on weather conditions, such as rainfall and prevailing temperatures.  As such, unfavorable weather conditions have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our sugar operations.Adverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, reduce demand for our fertilizer products and negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us.Severe adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or flooding, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries and other loss and damage to us. Our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services. A disruption in transportation services, as a result of weather conditions or otherwise, may also significantly adversely impact our operations.
We realize that water risks could cause a substantive change in our business.  First, our operations could be affected if we had to shut down our manufacturing facilities due to a lack of water.  This would significantly impact our revenues.  Next, if water related risks impact our suppliers, we could either be impacted by not being able to obtain enough ingredients to make our products or have to pay a higher price for them.  At the end of the day, both of these things would have a negative impact on our revenues.

Our operations are exposed if there is a drought situation that limits our ability to use water for the manufacture of our paper products.  Climate change has impacted our region and we are experience wide variations in winter snow pack and wide variations in summer precipitation.
We define substantive change by risks due water that materially impact our business, operations, revenue or expenditure in a negative way for a significant period of time that would prevent us from carrying on normal operations and manufacturing activities to make and ship our products to customers.  A substantive scenario could lead to reduced business in the mid-term, reduction in revenue, and increase expenditures to cope with realized risk time periods.

Clorox has enterprise risk management processes to identify, assess and prioritize business risks. Clorox uses a systematic process to evaluate risks. The process includes identifying risks, assessing exposures and quantifying the value at risk to the company. The evaluation considers level of potential impact, the overall vulnerability to an event based on the time and our capacity to react and adapt, and the likelihood of an occurrence.While severe regional weather events have the potential to disrupt our operations, or that of our customers and/or suppliers, we believe our dispersed supply chain affords us redundancy, which mitigates risk to our business from localized events. Additionally, Clorox engages in engineering loss-prevention strategies aimed at reducing the risk of natural and accidental hazards and each location has backup power supply for critical functions. The company’s manufacturing locations have comprehensive emergency response plans and most locations have business continuity plans. The company’s headquarters also has an emergency response plan with trained floor wardens, established evacuation procedures and business continuity plans for critical functions. We believe the location of our facilities limit threats from rising ocean levels.
Colgate uses an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program to identify, assess, prioritize and manage physical risks. The ERM Committee is sponsored by the Chairman, President and CEO of the Company and includes representation from key internal business leaders.  Risks are collectively identified across the organization and are classified within the Strategic, Financial, Operational, Information Technology, Legal & Compliance and Emerging Risk Categories.  Each Risk Category is assigned an owner who is also a member of the ERM Committee and who is ultimately accountable for successfully managing the identified risk.  The Natural Disaster ERM - addresses the physical risks associated with water and climate change that could disrupt our commercial and supply chain operations.   Colgate also has a formal process to identify critical suppliers (e.g. high volume suppliers, suppliers of critical materials, non-substitutable formulas). Every year we update our segmentation strategies where we classify materials and suppliers according to the criticality of the material segment as well as the market complexity and buyer power using a matrix tool. Selected agricultural materials that are impacted by change in precipitation extremes and droughts are considered in this process. Risk management plans including changes in source of supply and potential alternative formulations are in place.For purposes of this survey, we used a screening criteria to identify sites meeting the CDP guidance for "substantive" as follows: 1) sites indicated as "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk per WRI Aqueduct, and 2) which are either considered strategic sites or those which account for >2% of global production volume.This threshold is evaluated annually, when the Aqueduct tool is used to evaulate water risk. The Global Sustainability and EHS group engages with local sites to evaluate the threshold based on both the Aqueduct tool and more short-term and local conditions and events.

As stated in our most recent filing with the SEC on February 25, 2015: "Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require water, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change. As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints that could adversely affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run."

Water-related risks are particularly relevant to the food industry, with a global supply chain intensely dependent on the availability of clean water to grow ingredients. Managing water risk — both at our own facilities and those embedded in our supply chain — is critical to ConAgra Foods’ long-term business success. ConAgra Foods defines substantive change in our business as those risks that impact our business strategy for a majority of ConAgra Foods operations, products or supply, applying to both our direct operations and supply chain.  Measures used to evaluate water risk include (1) the numbers of facilities, brands, and products affected; and (2) volume and spend of ingredients and raw materials affected by water risk.
Substantive changes include restricted access to freshwater, the inability to obtain permits to recycle water within our operations, inability to build the requisite infrastructure to recycle our water, and any changes in regulatory requirements which would make it infeasible or us unable to economically treat and ultimately dispose of produced water.

In defining substantive change to our business, operations, revenues or expenditures from water risk, Constellation considers both the magnitude of potential loss, and the likelihood of the risk.  For the purposes of this report, we define substantive change as the potential loss of 5% of our global production volume as well as the potential loss of 5% in each segment of our business (beer vs. wine & spirits) . This metric includes only our direct operations and not our supply chain.

Cummins uses a multi-pronged approach to evaluating risks and opportunities and determining if they are substantive to our business: 	Cummins Business Continuity Planning function prioritizes and addresses key risks of which water related issues are one component. Cummins developed a detailed cause and effect (C&E) matrix to prioritize our sites combining multiple factors including: 1) the site’s self-assessment of water risk from a survey on source water sustainability, quality, discharge, regulatory, and cost considerations addressing both current and future (2017 and beyond) conditions, 2) the size and complexity of the site, 3) the presence or absence of water supply assessments, 4) and watershed-specific water stress indicators.  For water stress indicators, Cummins worked with an external consultant to develop a composite picture of current and future water stress by combining data from WRI Aqueduct Tool, WBCSD Global Water Tool, and consultant expertise in the countries/regions where we operate. Portions of this data extend to a 2025 planning horizon.  Scoring and weighting factors were applied to each of the 4 components of the C&E matrix and an ‘at risk’ threshold was defined as any sites scoring 150 or above in total composite score. Based upon these results, Cummins conducted detailed watershed assessments at each of the 3 locations scoring above the 150 ‘at risk’ threshold, recently we added two more sites.  BFCEC due to its growth that raised the risk scoring and CBL due to specific water issues arising in the area. In addition to the watershed assessments over 20 site level audits have been conducted to further validate conditions at prioritized sites.  These audits and assessments identified specific areas for water management improvements including conservation, risk management, and community/watershed engagement opportunities.Facility data and conditions are reviewed annually and may alter the priority sites form year to year, but a formal risk assessment using the full cause and effect matrix tool is planned to be conducted every 5 years.A six sigma project scheduled for 2015 completion will help determine the level of participation for our suppliers in relation to our water goals. This may determine the necessity of risk evaluations as well as water reporting requirements, conclusions will be made at project completion.
To generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue, or expenditure, any particular event or change would have to impact either a wide range of product lines or a large swath of our stores. Because of the wide geographical diversity and the many diverse product lines that we sell, an impact on any one store or product line would not substantively impact the company as a whole.

With respect to water risks, Darden attributes substantive changes to financial indicators such as significant increases in energy costs or costs of goods sold, decreases in revenue or impact in guest traffic at our restaurants. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants -- caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes -- are considered such substantive changes. Such shortages or interruptions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. We may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products. Supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations. If we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages, it may negatively impact our sales. If we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu, that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits.
As stated in our 2014 fiscal year 10-K, John Deere's business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment.  This may include water related items such as timing and quantity of rainfall, excessive rain, flooding and drought conditions. Due to the variability and uncertainty of weather conditions affecting our customers globally, for the purposes of this CDP response we are focused on our direct operations, and the water risk attributes of water scarcity and volume. Using WRI Aqueduct Tool, we define substantive change from water risk in terms of water scarcity and volume for those manufacturing and distribution operations currently sited in regions defined as having a baseline water stress of  extremely high stress, moderately high stress, high stress and moderate stress considering a projected change over 20 years. We also determine if these sites are considered strategic meaning they account for >2% of global production volume. If both criteria are met, then these sites could pose a substantive change in our business, operations or revenue.

Dell's largest water risk is associated with supply chain disruption caused by climate change and other water hazards. These disruptions cause loss in revenue from loss of availability and increase in operations costs as alternative suppliers are utilized at greater costs. A risk that we are continuing to focus on is water scarcity. Much of Dell's water consumption is based around municipal use, so we have chosen to focus on water consumption in water stressed regions. The water consumption is already relatively low, and we would like to take the opportunity to protect our reputation as a responsible resource consumer.

We publish information about the Company’s activities, including water-related risks, in official filings.  For example, we addressed water-related issues in our 2014 Form 10-K Annual Report to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Water-related issues included in the Form 10-K are those that are determined to be information that a reasonable investor would attach importance in determining whether to buy, hold, or sell Dominion securities.  For the purpose of the Water CDP, we are defining water risks that could generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure as those issues identified in our 2014 Form 10-K Annual Report.
The majority of our operations and supply chain takes place in Michigan, which has an abundant fresh water supply.  Although the risks to our company are low at this time, the risks are expected to increase in the future(e.g. as regulations continue to change and challenge our industry ).
DuPont defines substantive change in terms of the SEC definition for materiality. What constitutes “material” must be judged from the viewpoint of a reasonably prudent investor making a decision to buy, hold or sell stock. An item is considered material, if in the light of surrounding circumstances, the magnitude of the item is such that it is probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the item. DuPont does not believe it has any material water risks.  Please refer to Item 1A of our annual 10-K report for a discussion of risk factors.

We employ a multifaceted process to determine our company’s material issues in order to align materiality with our company and customers’ key business drivers. Ecolab’s annual enterprise “Assessment of Significant Business Risks” provides the foundation for assessing the materiality of issues to our business. The annual assessment is conducted using a survey tool designed to identify strategic, operational, financial and compliance-related risks to the company. Risks are documented along with the likelihood and impact of their occurrence. An audit-services vice president manages the process, and the results are presented to the executive committee and Ecolab board of directors. The most significant business risks are reported publicly through the company’s annual 10-K filing, where in 2013, human-resource issues such as employee attraction and retention are included as potential business risks. Using the Assessment of Significant Business Risks as a foundation, we undertook a rigorous process to analyze risks and opportunities specific to sustainability in 2013. We embarked on a strategic approach to better understand and measure against the issues that present material risks and opportunities to our company as they align with the interests of our stakeholders (primarily customers) but we also engage a diverse set of stakeholders to assess the materiality of sustainability-specific issues including employees, customers, investors and relevant external groups.Substantive change to our business as it relates to water risk is based upon an assessment of water risks at our direct manufacturing operations related to our production volume where it can effect greater than 10% of our facilities by production. This assessment and its criteria are reviewed annually and incorporated into our annual business risk assessment and reporting processes.

Substantive change from water risk would result in a change or stoppage in production or revenue, or a large change in expenditures relating to water.
In our business, bulk active ingredient manufacturing sites use the largest amounts of water followed by final dosage finishing sites.  Packaging sites require very little water and present less risk to the organization. In our Global Supply Chain, we already take into account manufacturing issues that could shut down bulk active ingredient sites for 6 to 10 months, drug final dosage finishing manufacturing for 2 to 3 months and packaging for 1 to 2 months.  We use inventory management practices as a primary risk mitigation strategy.  An extreme water stress event (i.e. a drought that provided a moratorium on water use for many months) would have to extend beyond these periods for there to be a potential economic impact on Lilly. Our Global Supply Chain area also works with our Treasury area and an external consultant to develop scenarios of "catastrophic" events (i.e. a manufacturing site being "destroyed"). We determined that a drought/water disruption scenario would have to extend for a long period of time (i.e. several years) to cause a substantive change to our business. Given these conditions and our product mix, we made a determination that extended periods of drought should not significantly impact our business.  Costs associated with these analyses are imbedded in operating budgets and are not disclosed.
EMC defines a substantive change as one that has impacts on our direct operations and/or our supply chain. Water-related impacts would be considered substantive to EMC if they cause a material impact to our costs of goods through rising component prices, reduced component availability, extensive damage to inventory, or labor shortages. Substantive impacts would also be those that lengthen time-to-market, reduce market demand, or affect a large or critical part of our workforce or physical infrastructure. Positive impacts that are substantive to EMC’s business may arise from new market opportunities that drive demand for EMC products and services.For questions W3.2a-c, we used the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool to assess EMC's direct operations - our campus facilities, manufacturing facilities, and COEs (Centers of Excellence). Those facilities that have "Medium to High", "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk are considered to be facing water risk that could generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure.

Operational risks are defined as the risk of loss or lost opportunity resulting from the following: reserves and resources replacement, capital activities and operating activities. Encana's ability to operate, generate cash flows, complete projects, and value reserves and resources is subject to many risks including the ability to access water for hydraulic fracturing operations.  To mitigate these risks, as part of the capital approval process, Encana’s projects are evaluated on a fully risked basis, including geological risk and engineering risk.
The Enbridge Liquid Pipelines business unit defines risk to water as having a substantive change to our business using a standardized risk matrix to evaluate risk consequence and likelihood.  Where Enbridge’s operations could impact water the risk consequence is considered to be Major to Critical; however the likelihood of events occurring at these locations is kept Low through multiple control and mitigation measures.  The risk consequence of an impact to water range defined as Major to Critical ranges in financial value from >$1M to ≤$1B, impacts an area ranging in size from 0.1 ha to 1 km2 and impacts a waterbody ranging from a wetland to a lake or fast moving creek or river.  Ecological restoration activities could last from 1 to 10 years in duration.   Project risks around water which could contribute to substantive changes to business are assessed through the use of a Risk Screening Tool.  Risk levels are classified as Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High with a set of detailed impact criteria associated to each level.  Risks associated with leaks and spills to water from a stakeholder materiality perspective are considered to have a Very High Impact and Very High Probability.  The Impact Criteria include costs in excess of $50M, a delay in milestone achievements (i.e. project completion) of greater than 6 months and a service disruption of greater than 1 month for our customers.
Enerplus defines substantive change as any change that would affect the economic viability of an operational area or facility, triggering a new evaluation of whether the facility is a net asset or liability.  For instance, if the cash flows no longer exceed the anticipated abandonment or the cumulative positives are less than the book value (up front capital), there may be a write down or a test that determines if there needs to be a write down.

Entergy views substantive change as any water risk issue having the potential to rise to the materiality level requiring SEC disclosure.  The measure(s) used in the definition of substantive change are:  a) any water risk issue potentially resulting in a compliance violation, permit exceedance, or breach of an agreement, or  b) any physical water risk that could interrupt operation of power plants.The threshold used is a change in the metric/measure/indicator which indicates substantive impact on direct operations, supply chain or both.  Thresholds vary by indicator. For example, any single permit exceedance would meet the threshold for that indicator.The frequency and process for review: The metrics and thresholds above are reviewed or updated and reported quarterly, first through the Water Peer Group and subject matter experts then again reviewed during the Enterprise Risk Mgmt Process (ERM)

The basis for expressing the percentage of operation affected is based on plants identified using WRI AqueDuct risk mapping plus our own plant-specific information.  The calculation is: total net generation MWh of the facilities located in water stress regions divided by the total net generation MWh produced by the generation facilities over which Exelon has operational control.  This percentage does not include operations related to the marketing and distribution of electricity or natural gas, which have less significant water uses. Exelon Corporation compiled an enterprise-wide inventory of water withdrawals and associated discharges for the calendar year 2014. Subsequently, Exelon used the WRI AqueDuct to screen for potential geographic water scarcity.  All facilities identified in the screening process as being potentially located in water scarce areas were further evaluated using internal company knowledge and regional basin management information to confirm the model output.  The WRI AqueDuct uses twelve global maps grouped into physical risk quantity, quality, and regulatory and reputational risk. The seven physical quantity risks include: baseline water stress; inter-annual variability; seasonal variability; floods; drought severity; upstream storage and groundwater. Physical water quality risks include return flow ratio and upstream protected land.  The three regulatory and reputational risks include media coverage, access to water and threatened amphibians.   Overall water risk assessment identifies areas with higher exposure to these water-related risks and is an aggregated measure.  In the past Exelon used the UNEP water stress map: http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/jpg/0221-waterstress-EN.jpg which showed that Exelon had no operations in water stressed areas based on the UNEP definition, i.e., less than 1700 cubic meters per person per year.  WRI’s new AqueDuct assessment tool is far more broad in its definition of water stress; and therefore we have identified additional areas where we operate that are subject to water stress as defined in the multivariate analyses WRI uses in their AqueDuct tool.

Our analysis of Ford operations shows that some of our facilities are located in regions where water supplies are already scarce. Global climate change also has the potential to further impact the quality and availability of water. We cannot be certain that we will always have access to water of the quantity and quality that our operations require. Our water strategy puts primary emphasis on our plants located in areas of water scarcity. Ford is committed to conserving water and using it responsibly. We will address water challenges internally within our own operations and externally in communities where we operate and throughout our supply chain. We have committed to measureable actions to support our global water strategy. In deciding which facilities and which basins concern Ford, aggregate scores from the Global Water Tool (subwatershed level) were used alongside internal knowledge of specific facilities and local watersheds. If a facility had a high risk or projected risk by the tools, it was listed. The operating facilities listed as “substantive” had to have a high stress or risk and have a production or support production of greater than 1% of global relevant production (vehicle, engines, or transmissions). This definition of risk applies to Ford’s direct operations. This definition is not applied to supply chain operations. Ford operations are reviewed annually for performance against this metric. The metric is reviewed approximately every 5 years for relevancy as part of the water strategy update.

GM’s risk and opportunities identification process is as follows: - Executives from GM’s various functions and geographic locations have been appointed as risk officers- Annually, these risk officers identify, evaluate and assess various company and asset risks and opportunities. Risk officers review results with their respective Executive Leadership Team (ELT)(i) Company level Risks and opportunities are categorized as Tier 1, 2 or 3 based on frequency, how quickly they may materialize, and on their potential impact to the company.  Impact may be measured by a number of variables including reputational, operational, revenue, etc.  - All Tier 1 have approved mitigation plans, and are reviewed in detail regularly by the ELT and by the Board.  - All Tier 2 risks have approved mitigation plans and are reviewed at least once a year by the ELT within GM and by the BOD.  - All Tier 3 risks have been fully analysed, put on a “watch list” and are regularly reviewed by the risk officer and their respective ELT member.(ii) Water Risks identified as Asset level risks have mitigation plans that are responsibility of day-to-day management.  Exposure to and experience with catastrophic risk or losses from climate change or other natural events are continuously analyzed and reviewed for ongoing operations and when evaluating new sites and supplier selection. Asset level risks are generally those that are anticipated to occur with regular or high frequency, but have an overall low impact on the company and can be absorbed by the reserves on the annual balance sheet.  Lessons learned are incorporated into future site planning, supplier selection process, and risk mitigation planning and strategic development.While the risks related to water at individual GM facilities is not substantive in total to GM, there are some facilities located in Australia, Brazil, China, Egypt, Kenya, Mexico, and South Africa that do have high water related risks.

Based on the nature and scope of our business operations and  our interaction with suppliers, IBM does not perceive any unusual water-related risks in our operations or the supply chain outside of those we plan for as part of our ongoing business and risk management processes. These risk management processes look at business risk comprehensively including, but not limited to, risks and impacts related to water use and discharge. We anticipate that the business models of both IBM’s and our production and service suppliers’ operations will enable those operations to anticipate and adapt to potential risks and mitigate the impacts without significant disruptions to our business. This risk management approach is primarily achieved through implementation of the IBM global Environmental Management System, established for over 40 years, which is integrated into our business operations

Intel’s Board of Directors and management consider “risk” for these purposes to be the possibility that an undesired event could occur that might adversely affect the achievement of our objectives. Risks vary in many ways, including the ability of the company to anticipate and understand the risk, the types of adverse impacts that could occur if the undesired event occurs, the likelihood that an undesired event and a particular adverse impact would occur, and the ability of the company to control the risk and the potential adverse impacts. The types of risks that Intel faces include:• Macro-economic risks such as inflation, reductions in economic growth, or recession• Political risks such as restrictions on access to markets, confiscatory taxation, and expropriation of assets• “Event” risks such as natural disasters• Business-specific risks related to strategic position, operational execution, financial structure, legal and regulatory compliance, corporate governance, and environmental stewardshipNot all risks can be dealt with in the same way. Some risks may be easily perceived and controllable, while others are unknown; some risks can be avoided or mitigated by a particular behavior; and some risks are unavoidable as a practical matter. In some cases, a higher degree of risk may be acceptable because of a greater perceived potential for reward.

Interruption of production could present a change, depending on the product(s) impacted.  This change could be substantive, due to the customer need for the product, the revenue we derive from the product, and/or the expenditure required to prevent interruption or to restore production.*Note: CDP's phrasing of "substantive" and our response to questions presenting "substantive" risks should not be considered to relate to matters or facts that could be deemed “material” to a reasonable investor as referred to under U.S. securities laws or similar requirements of other jurisdictions.  Investors should rely on disclosures in our Annual ("10-k") filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of "material" matters.
We define substantive as having a material financial impact on the entire enterprise.  Although some facilities may be subject to water risks, such risks at the enterprise level are not financially material.

Juniper prioritizes risks and opportunities found to be material. Materiality of an issue is assessed as follows:• The value, or risk, of the issue to business operations: Using our corporate strategy, 2-3-7, Juniper looks at whether the issue represents a significant risk or opportunity to our company or industry? Is it current or emerging? Is it already part of the sustainability strategy or does it need to be added? • The priority of the issue to our stakeholders: Does this issue resonate with our key stakeholders? Is it reflected in pending legislation, regulations, or international agreements?• Peers and competitors: Do Juniper’s peers and competitors disclose against this issue? How do they respond?• Juniper’s influence over the issue: To what extent does Juniper have control or influence over the issue through our direct actions, industry associations, or networks?• Relevant and applicable voluntary global reporting and standards and guidelines: Is the issue addressed by the standard disclosures of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines or by other relevant and applicable global voluntary standards?Juniper’s approach to materiality is aligned with our 2-3-7 strategy. The strategy provides a structure and hierarchy for prioritizing the value, or risk, of an issue on Juniper’s business operations. It is based on the following approach: 2: Is this issue critical to our two key customer segments (Service Provider & Enterprise)? 3: Is this issue critical to supporting our three key business segments (Routing, Switching & Security)? 7: Is this issue relevant to our seven product domains (Access & Aggregation, Edge, Core, Data Center, wide area network, Campus & Branch, & Consumer & Enterprise Devices)? If the answer is yes to all of these questions above, then the risk is deemed to have potential substantive impact.Water risks have been identified and evaluated to determine if they could generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure in the present and future. Risk mitigation and management plans have been developed, implemented and are being monitored. As a result of the implemented processes and engineering controls, the water risks are not considered material.

Kimberly-Clark's tissue business is very water intensive, and relies significantly on the availability of adequate supplies.  Any interruption in the water supply would directly curtail production and force the shutdown of the facility until the water supply is restored.  For any expansion, or new greenfield site, the availability of adequate fresh water supply is very important.  Because of this, all new expansions or new tissue machines will employ state-of-the-art water conservation technologies, and, new wastewater plants will employ the latest technology in water recycling.  These efforts incur a higher expenditure than traditional technologies. The threshold for substantive risk is <1% of global production capacity, which applies to direct operations. Risk is evaluated annually and the risk mitigation plan is implemented and adjusted based on the analysis.

Ongoing drought in California is anticipated to continue through the next few years.  Taiwan is also experiencing drought effects.  Changes to the business would only be affected by water usage and restrictions for personnel on-site.  Water is minimally used in the production process for stencil cleaning, and alternative methodologies for replacing stenciling requiring water cleaning are underway.
"Substantive Change" is defined as a plus or minus 5% change in the company annual revenue. Based on 2014 revenues, this equates to revenue of US$173,300,000.

As mentioned previously, a lot of the product manufactured at our facility contain a large quantity of water. In the event of water shortage, it would be impossible for us to continue our operations without purchasing water tankers supplied by another community. This would cost us a lot more than the cost of the withdrawal of the town water and would impact our financial health.

Lockheed Martin considers water-related risks to be location specific and does not deem water to pose a material impact, or "substantive change," to enterprise-wide business operations, revenue or expenditure currently or within the next 3 years. For the purposes of Water CDP disclosure, water-related risks are present within certain regions where we or key suppliers operate that could lead to deviations from normal business operations (e.g., increased process time, disrupted material flow, supply chain delay, etc.) and/or a change in revenue or costs to the affected facility and/or supplier caused by a water shortage, regulatory water restriction, water-related natural catastrophe, or other water-related impact.Lockheed Martin selects sites that could contribute to substantive change to our business by using a screening process as follows: 1) Identify sites indicated as “High” or “Extremely High” overall water risk using our combined risk score of the WBCSD Global Water risk tool score, water use ranking, and local/regional consultant risk score and then 2) Cross check whether these sites are considered mission critical because they house production for key programs.

While the scale and geographic diversification of our business makes it unlikely that localized water risks could generate a substantive change in our overall business, we regularly evaluate some of the more prevalent and pressing water risks that do impact properties in our managed portfolio and present that information below.  Even if these risks do not currently have the potential to reduce our revenue by more than 5%, they impact the communities in which we operate and the health and safety of our associates. We not only comply with regulatory action but also strive to help address these issues where possible.

As a starting point, we considered sites at high or extreme (>40%) risk of baseline water stress as defined by WRI Aqueduct as those with potential to cause substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure locally. For these sites, we have analyzed the additional information collected via our watershed governance survey to identify those reporting past incidents or future risks related to water. We then calculated water consumption for these affected sites as a proportion of our total water consumption, and mapped this against production volumes to give the proportion of our total business at risk.In our supply chain, we have carried out an initial assessment to identify raw materials from regions subject to water related risk, including rice, tea, peanuts, tomatoes and mint. As part of the development of our sustainable sourcing strategy, we plan to conduct in-depth water impact assessments where necessary to focus our efforts on raw materials where water is a significant impact. This process will help us to define substantive change in our business from water impacts in our supply chain.

Microsoft has determined that, at present, our business is not exposed to water risks that could generate a substantive change to our business, operations, revenue, or expenditure. From an operational perspective, substantive change for our office and lab facilities would include a requirement to significantly alter, close, and/or relocate the operations of a particular facility or group of facilities. This could include impacts on employees and/or technology equipment. Our operational analysis includes a three-part filter of all of our facilities to identify those that potentially represent the greatest risk: 1) location in water basins with high baseline water stress or the future potential for high baseline water stress; 2) annual average electricity use >60 kWh per square foot (large electricity users being datacenters); and 3) if the facility represents >1% of total companywide electricity use (using electricity as proxy for the size and/or relative importance of the facility to our company). On the basis of this filter and analysis, we determined that our office and lab operations are not exposed to substantive water risk. We review our approach annually as we respond to the CDP water questionnaire and take the opportunity to reassess our risk assessment procedures and look for opportunities to formalize and integrate the various risk assessments that take place within the organization.Similarly, substantive change for our datacenters would entail the need to significantly alter, close, and/or relocate a datacenter in response to water risk that would affect our ability to deliver continuous customer services. We engage all utilities (water/sewer/power/fiber) during site selection due diligence. Capacity and quality are vetted and service agreements put in place prior to completing the transaction. Where future expansion plans are unknown, we obtain commitment letters from the utilities indicating that they can provide for future demand (often subject to expansion of existing infrastructure). We do not locate datacenters where utility constraints would prevent us from operating those facilities. On this basis, we determined that our datacenters are not exposed to substantive water risks.

The current drought in California could have an impact on operating expenses at our Sunnyvale facility (if tiered water rates change) as well as on capital expenditures if we are required to retrofit some of our existing cooling towers to reduce the consumption of domestic water. In addition, water availability could affect the prices of our components, since a number of our suppliers (e.g, semiconductor manufacturers) can use significant amount of water in their manufacturing processes.

NRG’s definition of substantive risk is the possibility that an event will occur and significantly affect the achievement of NRG’s business goals.  In this case, the event is described as a water shortage situation at the plant level.NRG uses the measures, metrics and indicators for water risk assessment leveraging the management and professional judgment from the following perspectives:•Financial impact:    1)Corporate earnings   2)Capital expenditure on technologies to reduce water consumption and withdrawal •Plant operation    1)Operation disruption due to water shortage   2)Increase in costs of water usage•Environmental impact   1)Higher demand for fossil fuel generation units in California in light of low hydro power may result in more  water consumption and withdrawal    2)Further reducing water reserve in California  Water risk is monitored by Risk Owners (Plant Operators) and reported to management upon material changes in water consumption and withdrawal levels.  Risk identification and assessment process applies to both direct operation and supply chain. NRG does not have a threshold or amount of change to determine if the water risk is substantive. NRG Regional Vice Presidents present the modelling scenarios for water risk determination.Plant level NRG Water usage analysis is presented and reviewed in 2014 and is reviewed annually.NRG water usage analysis is reviewed by the management of NRG Operations, Engineering and Commercial Operations.

At the enterprise level:  The Office of Compliance Assurance is responsible for the corporate risk management process and for raising awareness of key risks and reporting results directly to the Board of Director’s Audit Committee.  It is comprised of senior leaders and meets annually.  They are informed of climate-change related risks by different stakeholders within the various business units depending on the risk or opportunity considered.  As an example of a key climate-change related opportunity, product innovation is managed and monitored by the product innovation team for each business group.  These teams carefully monitor customer demands, market trends, and the regulatory landscape and incorporate trends into product development.  As an example of a key climate-change related enterprise risk from increased operational expenses from carbon regulation, the corporate energy department monitors legislation and energy use by operations, determines corporate-wide strategies on procurement, energy reduction programs and alternative energy products.  This strategy is ultimately reported to the Office of Compliance Assurance to ensure that climate-change related risks are appropriate mitigated and that opportunities are pursued.At the asset level: Each business unit assesses risks and opportunities at an asset level using ongoing systematic structures and processes.  For asset protection, each business unit is responsible for developing a business continuation plan that provides for the protection of Parker Hannifin assets. These plans are routinely audited by Parker’s Risk Management team.  For compliance, each business unit is required to stay in compliance with regulatory, internal and customer requirements.

Risks related to water and climate change identified by the Company and included in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K include:•	“Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities, increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.”  Specifically we state that such changes may include: “laws regulating access to and use of water or utilities; and environmental laws, including laws relating to the regulation of water rights, treatment and discharge of wastewater and air emissions.”•	“Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies.”  Specifically we state that: “Water is also a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of available water of acceptable quality and increasing pressure to conserve water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to supply chain disruption, adverse effects on our operations or higher production costs that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.”•	“Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.”  Specifically we state that: “In addition, water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and demand for water continues to rise. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to water use.”While we do not believe that the individual instances of water risk highlighted in this report would constitute a substantive risk on their own due to the total size of our business and our ability to source and manufacture from different plants if it became necessary, the potential cumulative impact of water stress on our manufacturing operations and supply chain could become substantive in the future.  Due to the uncertain nature of climate change on future water stress and availability, we cannot say with certainty the timeframe or level of impact that we might see, so we need to plan for a range of possible impacts.

Sempra Energy’s 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission identifies the risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.  The 10-K identifies a few risk factors that are or could be a result of water-related issues, particularly drought.   However, for transparency purposes, in this response we have also included additional water-related risks that we have identified.  These risks do not meet the threshold of materiality relevant to our 10-K filing, but we believe are useful in providing to context to the significance of water in our operations and supply chain and therefore merit inclusion in this discussion.

Using the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool, we determined which major manufacturing and distribution facilities were located in water-stressed regions (having a "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk as determined by the tool) .  Substantive change will depend on how much product is produced or distributed from that facility as a percentage of total operations.

Sprint believes there are some risks associated with water, but does not believe these risks are material (per SEC reporting guidelines).In Sprint's direct operations, water is used in evaporative chiller systems to cool data centers, and large network and commercial office locations. Sprint defines substantive change from water risk as a forced replacement of operational equipment with alternative technology. Substantive change is based on the Mean Annual Relative Water Stress Index (2000) obtained by inputting data about Sprint's sites into World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Global Water Tool utilized to identify water stress areas in our US-based operations. We combined our facility water-usage information with the information from WBCSD and found that 17 of Sprint’s top 99 water usage sites (90% of consumption) are in highly water-stressed areas.Through Sprint's Trucost analysis, we have been able to assess the scope of water consumed in its supply chain. In 2014, its supply chain accounted for 99.5 percent of Sprint's overall water footprint. From here, Sprint plans on engaging its top water-consuming suppliers to begin understanding what substantive risks to Sprint's business, operations, revenues or expenditure their water usage poses.
Substantive change would be any change considered material to our financial results, or impacting several or more stores in a region, as well as changes which would require capital investment.  We review our business annually during development of our operating plan and review progress against this quarterly.

In terms of water risk, Starwood defines a substantive change to be anything more than 5%. One particular metric which has been used to measure substantive changes resulting from water risk is "total guest rooms". Therefore, when using this metric, more than 5% of all Starwood guest rooms, globally, must be affected to be considered substantive.

For Staples, substantive changes in how we do business, as a result of water risk, could include (1) instability in our supply chain due to increased water scarcity, which would impact suppliers' ability to produce products we sell and our ability to sell them; (2) increased cost to procure products due to increased water scarcity and utility costs for our suppliers; (3) increased cost of doing business due to increased water scarcity and utility costs in our own operations; and (4) decreased revenues due to customers decreasing their purchases of water-intensive products.

SBD's global Water Scarcity Plan is based on our 2012 strategic communication, a 2013 launch of our global water scarcity strategy, and 2014-15 updates of such.  This in-process management method included mapping current SBD locations against the United Nations Environment Program's vital water graphic (2nd edition, 2008), performing a risk evaluation to prioritize our top 10 water consuming sites, and instituting water conservation efforts, governmental collaboration projects, and options for alternative water sources at high risk sites. This management method is also used to assess level of risk potential during acquisition transaction considerations and due diligence.  An example of a specific activity or project performed to manage water risk included our manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan reducing process water withdrawals by nearly 40 percent by reusing cooling water collected from the rectifier for the spray application, ostensibly eliminating the need for water extraction from the on-site groundwater supply well.  These actions were designed to offset and lower the high risk score for this facility determined from our Water Scarcity Plan management method.

Suncor uses an enterprise wide risk management system (ERM) to assess and define risk.  Like most ERM systems it uses a matrix that determines the consequence of a risk and the likelihood.  There are six (6) consequence and likelihood categories.  The ERM assign risks a ranking from I to IV for economic, environmental and social. Social is further broken down into Health & Safety, Reputation and Regulatory with guidance.  Suncor defines substantive risks that are risked rank at II or I; this translates into a number of different consequence-probability combinations that will not be listed here. Suncor is currently in the process of revising the ERM and it is expected to be rolled out for 2016. To simplify define substantive change for the purpose of this survey an economic value of $10M was used.

Substantive change to the business is measured primarily by financial impact.  We do not isolate water risk when identifying the materiality of substantive changes; rather, water risk is considered amongst other factors when evaluating overall financial impacts.  For example, in a drought situation, water availability would be one of many impacts that could contribute to substantive changes – inflation of certain products, product availability, and opportunities to seek alternative suppliers would also be considered when evaluating financial impact and defining substantive change.

Substantive change for our business as it relates to water availability would be lack of water necessary to conduct our manufacturing operations in a manner that complies with all applicable food safety regulatory requirements and standards.  Lack of water could be from on-site sources or from water supply sources, and could include significant curtailment of typical water supply needed to run the operation.  Another aspect of risk would be the ability to obtain ingredients that rely on adequate water supply for crop harvesting to meet production based on customer demands. Substantive change from an expenditure standpoint would be requirements to implement costly water reduction or conservation measures or equipment which would not result in a return on investment that meets our hurdle rate or an expenditure to obtain water or ingredients from alternative sources.

Changes in precipitation patterns result in drought or flood conditions that will impact landfill function, not only in terms of additional costs to maintain operations but also will impact potential revenues from the collection and use of landfill gas for energy.  Virtually any of WM’s landfills in the U.S. and Canada are vulnerable to intermittent drought conditions, flood conditions or both.Both flooding and drought impact the behaviors of materials decaying in a controlled MSW landfill environment. Flooding can impede the collection of landfill gas by filling collection wells with water; drought can reduce the rate of decay of organic material because water is essential to the decay process. Both extreme conditions result in additional labor being required to manage the landfill gas collection system, with additional liquids collection required to respond to excess moisture and with adjustments to gas collection system vacuum required to respond to the decrease in gas generation resulting from too little moisture. Also, additional labor and costs are incurred in compliance with regulatory obligations. Also, although WM is not a high volume water user, temporary disruptions in water supply could affect our operations.

WhiteWave employs a multi-disciplinary approach to risk management, with a Board of Directors (BOD) that reviews opportunities or risks identified by our Executive Leadership Team as part of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program (financial, regulatory, compliance, etc.) that would materially impact our objectives.  ERM and the Risk Management Oversight Committee (RMOC) in N. America provide periodic updates to executive leadership discussing supply chain issues if they occur/when needed.  The Risk Refresh is an annual process where the risk portfolio and risk profiles are reviewed, discussed and tiered based on prioritization methodology.  Risks are considered as far into the future as reasonably possible. Sustainability updates are presented to the BOD after the annual environmental inventory is performed and as needed. Lastly, a cross-functional Issues Working Group (IWG) meets monthly to review emerging and ongoing issues affecting our brands, business & industry.For purposes of this survey, we used a screening criteria to identify sites meeting the CDP guidance for "substantive" as follows: 1) sites indicated as "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk per WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter, and 2) which are either considered strategic sites or those which account for >5% of global production volume.
With the drought in CA, we are engaging in water conservation practices and fixture retrofits.  We already executed much of this in southern California years ago.  A substantive change would mean we are moving toward a cap in supply and reduced availability.Other risks with the energy/water nexus may result in a much higher cost of operation due to both energy and water utilities' cost increases.

Our Board of Directors oversees our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process which strengthens our capability to monitor and manage all categories of business risk, including for example water scarcity and flooding. Xerox’s 14 Enterprise Level Risks are prioritized based on two factors: Level of Disclosure Required / Reputation Risk, up to and including the 10K or Public Media, and the Probability of the Risk Occurring over a 3-year timeframe. We prioritize the risks in terms of current risk profile as well as the projected risk profile upon completion of the documented risk mitigation plans. The knowledge gained from our CSR materiality assessment process also feeds into the Corporate ERM process to further influence strategy.Xerox’s formal documented Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) materiality assessment process considers relevant sustainability/CSR issues impacting Xerox products, services, processes and operations, including water in our operations and water in our supply chain. The criteria used in this process consider both ‘importance to our businesses stability and growth’ and ‘importance to sustainable development’. The criteria used are given a relative weighting and issues are given numerical scores against the criteria. Results are presented via a matrix so that the importance of the issues can be visually presented.Specific facilities within our direct operations exposed to water risk that could generate “a substantive change in our business operations, revenue or expenditure” have been identified based on meeting the following criteria:1.Facility  locations classified as water stressed or water scarce according to publically available water tools (WBCSD Global Water Tool, WWF Water Risk Filter and WRI Aqueduct); and2.Consideration of internal company knowledge (gained from for example the ERM and CSR processes described above) and the local situation, the facility type and size and thus potential to impact/reduce global revenue (i.e. the Technology business represents ~40% total global revenue).  For example toner manufacturing operations use water as raw material and thus, in the event of a future water restriction, have the potential for operations to be impacted resulting in potential additional costs associated with switching toner production to an alternative site.  Also large office/R&D facilities (i.e. >100 employees).

Substantive change to our business as it relates to water risk is based upon our assessment of water risks at our global data centers and offices, inclusive of our direct operations only (not including our supply chain). Substantive change would be one that increased operational expenditure on water in excess of 1% of total annual company spend. Since total expenditure on water and wastewater combined is far less than this, we do not anticipate substantive change to occur.  From an operational perspective, substantive change for facilities would include a requirement to significantly alter, close, and/or relocate the operations of a particular facility or group of facilities. Based on the results of our water risk assessment, there are no facilities that are sited in regions with identified water risk or stress that can generate a substantive change to occur.
We define substantive change to our operations from water risks as the prolonged or permanent shutdown of one of our operations

We use the Global Water tool to assess potential changes in our business and operations due to water stress.  Based on 2013 data, we identified approximately 60 sites that we considered to be scarce or extremely scarce based on annual renewable water supply per person for 1995 data and 2025 projections.   Many of these sites underwent various water conservation projects as a part of our previous goal and continue to be evaluated for additional conservation projects under our new goal.

Substantive change is defined as 1) an Extremely High risk ranking under the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool, 2) an overall ranking of Scarcity or Extreme Scarcity under the WBCSD Global Water Tool, or 3) water risk with financial impacts exceeding levels established by the internal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process (scoring and ranking is reviewed and updated annually).
A substantive risk could include, but may not be limited to, a curtailment or disruption of mine production, prevention of mine expansion opportunities, increased capital expenditure and operational maintenance costs associated with development of alternate and renewable water supplies, or increased capital expenditures and increased operating costs associated with water quality programs and technologies.

Cenovus’s operations, financial condition and in some cases our reputation, may be impacted by principal and strategic risks. Cenovus defines principal risks as those risks that when measured in terms of likelihood and impact, may adversely affect the achievement of our strategic or major business objectives. Strategic risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability to adequately plan or implement an appropriate business strategy, or to adapt to changes in the external business, political or regulatory environment. Risks are categorized into: •Financial risks, which include commodity price risk and liquidity risk; •Operational risks such as risks related to safety, the environment, transportation restrictions, project execution and reserves replacement; and •Regulatory risks from the regulatory approval process and changes to or introduction of environmental regulations including water conservation policy. We analyse risks using a Risk Matrix and other standardized assessment tools. Using the Risk Matrix, each risk is classified on a continuum ranging from "Low" to "Extreme" based on the potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. Impact ratings range from "Minor" to "Catastrophic" and the likelihood ratings range from "Expected" to "Improbable". Risks are first evaluated on an inherent basis, without considering the presence of controls or mitigating measures. Risks are then re-evaluated based on their residual risk ranking, reflecting the risk that remains after mitigation and control measures are considered. Risks classified as "High" or "Extreme" on Cenovus's Risk Matrix are included herein as "substantive".Our water risks were reviewed in 2014 and assessed based on estimated impact and likelihood. The water risks that were identified as significant risks involved future exposure (generally greater than 5 years in future) and rare likelihood risks. Risk impacts that were considered substantial involved: delay to new licences resulting in impacts to our developments plans; high costs of retrofitting new technologies on existing assets to meet more stringent regulations; or reputational impacts or negative media attention. These risks were assessed as having a rare likelihood of occurrence.

Although we do not use water within our manufacturing processes, we consider our company and supply chain subject to risks related to water, but do not consider the risks to be significant.  Like all companies, extreme weather events and resource shortages have the potential to interrupt our business and supply chain operations.  However, Motorola Solutions' operations generally are not located in low-lying areas subject to severe impacts from flooding.  Any disruption to our distribution channels could have a detrimental impact on our supply chain and product distribution.  Losses and interruption could be caused by water shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters, for which we predominantly are self-insured.

A possible risk would be increase to water costs and disposal rates due to high demand, especially at our facilities having higher water consumption for e-coat purposes.  Although it is difficult to say what is substantive at this time, any increases would impact on our overall business revenues and have to be absorbed.  We do not see changes in water rates changing any current operations.Business growth in the area of 2 of our Mexico facilities may further increase demand on water resources and water quality in these areas.

To define a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk, we consider an estimated potential financial impact in excess of $1 million as a threshold quantitative metric. In evaluating and estimating the potential financial impact, we consider numerous factors, including the proportion of business units affected, size of the impact on those business units, and degree of stakeholder concern. We also consider interdependencies among potential risks.Please note that based on this methodology, we have not currently identified any supply chain risks that meet our threshold for generating a substantive change. While we use a significant amount of water onsite for product delivery, our Company’s supply chain does not consist of a large portion of inputs that we would characterize as highly water-intensive compared to inputs within other sectors. Our largest purchase categories include bentonite/polymers, steel pipe, sand, paper, polyvinyl chloride, tricone bits and drill pipe components. Our capital goods consist primarily of our fleet and equipment for drilling, pumping, testing and other processes used for the delivery of goods and services to our customers. We purchase some cement from China, which is currently characterized as a water vulnerable region by the United Nations Environmental Programme. We also purchase fuel near project sites, some of which comes from the Middle East, in which certain areas have been classified as water-scarce and water-stressed. While we occasionally purchase parts locally to assist in project delivery, we have the ability to mitigate potential risks by shipping parts to sites, as needed and based on economic considerations. Additionally, we maintain multiple sourcing options.

Xylem does not have a corporate-wide definition for “substantive change” but since water is integrated into every component of our business, water risks are a key element of our risk management and business continuity planning. At Xylem, our vision is simple. We devote our technology, time and talent to advance the smarter use of water. We look to a future where global water issues do not exist. It is this vision that drives our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Function. Our risks are managed by a comprehensive ERM Program that has a corporate framework consisting of five key components: (1) Risk Appetite and Strategy, (2) Governance and Organization, (3) Policies and Procedures, (4) Risk Management Process, and (5) Monitoring and Reporting. This framework directly supports the ERM Program’s objective of establishing “practical and sustainable policies, procedures and processes that help the Company manage and monitor risk effectively.” As such, the Program and its framework provide the means by which Xylem monitors and prioritizes its risks and governs its risk profile. At Xylem, ERM is not a static concept that sits on a shelf. Rather, it is a dynamic process that continues to evolve with the Company.Every Xylem site is also responsible for developing and implementing a site-specific Business Continuity Plan, including as elements Crisis Management Plans and IT Disaster Recovery Plans. Xylem's set of Business Continuity policies sets forth the specific requirements for business continuity responsibility, planning, risk assessment and business impact analysis, reporting and program maintenance. This policy requires Xylem sites to have in place a comprehensive set of business strategies and actions designed to protect safety, minimize the impact of a business interruption and facilitate return to normal operational levels. This process requires sites to evaluate change on a frequent basis and plan for situations that could have a substantive change to our business before they actually do. This proactive procedure helps Xylem to mitigate the risks posed by water including increased water scarcity, regulatory uncertainty and declining water quality.

SDP has its own internal procedure on how to ensure the compliance of the company on water quality discharge in the Subic Techno Park sewer line going to Boton River. The management has also plan to re-use the treated water from the Sewage Treatment Plant in the urinals and toilets of Building 1 and Building 2. This project aims to reduce water consumption as well as cost reduction. In addition, SDP will zero discharge since treated water will re-use in the company.

We acknowledge that changes in water availability will have an impact on our company and we believe it deserves serious attention. However, based on our understanding of the CDP definition of “significance,” (independent of any analysis used for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting purposes), we have concluded that opportunities cited in this question cannot be categorized as having the potential to generate substantive change in our direct operations.

Substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure would include a reduced level of operations at any single facility such that the individual facility would not be capable of supplying the entire quantity of production needed to meet global demand for that product. Alternatively, substantive change in our business could result from one or more R&D programs.

Axalta recognizes that as participants in the global economy we must be stewards of the environment in which we operate. Making coatings involves the use of energy, raw materials and water and results in emissions and wastes of various kinds. In addition, we recognize that industrial processes can pose safety risks to employees and others when not carefully managed. We have programs in place designed to safeguard the health andsafety of our people, products and manufacturing processes, as well as the communities where we live. Our commitment to sustainability provides a guidepost for our behavior and a lens to measure our performance.Axalta considers a substantive change in operations as any event that can cause a negative impact to the health, safety, environment, reputation, financial, human rights and social issues. The company takes into account the water usage as well as the economic relevance/impact of the operations.

Birla Carbon’s production process has generally not changed over a number of years.  Where technological innovations are available we have made process changes to ensure maximum water efficiency utilization.  Through water retention and recycling programs and other conservation measures we do not anticipate substantive changes in our water risks unless there is some significant unforeseen circumstance in a specific geographic location where water resource might become unavailable or substantially increased in cost.  Poor water quality and potential flooding is possible in some of our locations and we have integrated those risks into our Enterprise Risk Management approach.

Substantive change is defined as any event that would cause significant interruption of product flow to our customers in any of the global markets that we serve.   While water is a key resource for manufacturing, the company is not exposed to significant physical risks at a global level. Risks associated with water to any single manufacturing site or locale could have a significant local impact; however, operating contingencies and geographic diversification limit these risks to Abbott's business, operations, revenue and expenditures.

At 3M, we continually evaluate our approach to opportunity and risk. We believe the whole concept of risk appetite and tolerance is an essential component of strategic planning.  This includes a broad risk oversight by the Board and its committees, with committee-level risk analyses reported to the full Board and executive-level internal auditor and Chief Compliance Officer appointed by, and reporting directly to, the Audit Committee.Enterprise Risk designation is reserved for a limited number of factors identified as having the potential to negatively, significantly and directly impact our enterprise value due to loss of revenues, earnings, balance sheet position or company reputation for an extended period of time.  Discussion of these factors, as it relates to the Company, are incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in 3M's Annual Report: http://s2.q4cdn.com/974527301/files/doc_financials/2015/ar/2015_3M_Annual_Report.pdf.

AMD defines substantive change to their business by using a screening process as follows: 1) identify sites indicated "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk using the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool 2) cross check whether high risk sites are considered strategic to AMD business and highly dependent on water availability3) determines whether high risk sites have appropriate contingency plans for sourcing water if local resources were not available. If high risk and strategic sites do not have adequate contingency plans, then the risks posed from these sites can contribute to a substantive change in our business.AMD is currently not aware of high water risk sites that generate a substantive change in our business operations, revenue, or expenditures in the near future.  We are aware of the importance of water to supply chain manufacturing operations but has not been identified as a substantive risk exposure.

We continue to evaluate our water use within existing processes to determine where cost-effective reduction opportunities are available, and we assess water reduction, reuse/recycle, or elimination alternatives during the replacement or upgrading of existing facilities. For new plants, we determine the long-term availability of water resources and what restrictions exist or will be imposed on wastewater discharges. Through our technology resources, we identify, develop, and deploy innovative solutions to address our opportunities and challenges. For example, we are using zero discharge systems whenever feasible.When appropriate, we collaborate with other businesses and stakeholders to fully understand all water-related opportunities and risks. For example, we participated in WBCSD’s efforts on sharing best practices and technology and charting a worldwide sustainable water course. At the location level, we have engaged with our stakeholders to ensure we are appropriately addressing all potential water-conflict situations.

Several Allergan  locations have experienced droughts. Water is delivered into the areas from several other locations to supplement the demand from the area.  Reuse of treated effluent to supplement existing groundwater resources has been instituted over the past four years in southern California.  Plans for mandatory water curtailment and water rationing were developed for these sites.  Water costs continue to climb as the resource becomes more restricted.  There have been no impacts to Allergan product manufacturing nor revenues as a result of these droughts to date.  The water cost increases have been minimal when compared to other utility costs such as electricity and fuel.  However, in Brazil, electricity is tied to water availability due to the high reliance on hydroelectric power in the country.  Droughts in Brazil do impact the electrical costs as well as the water costs, and are therefore more substantial.
Seasonal rainfall fluctuations may affect the volume and quality of crop production on farms within our supply chain.  We judge the risk to our business as low at this time due to our flexibility to source from other origins.A substantive change would require alternative sourcing from other locations and we have proven global supply chains to deliver this flexibility.

Potable water is a necessary resource to our manufacturing process. Should water become extremelyscarce in regions where we manufacture our products, it could potentially have an impact on our manufacturing operations. This potential risk has been identified at a functional level within Environment, Health, Safety, and Sustainability and is considered a low potential risk.
A substantive change is a significant modification or expansion in the scope or nature of Anadarko’s direct operations (not suppliers) at a field level, as measured by the level of activity or production of an asset from sourcing, management or disposal of water. Anadarko has a deep portfolio of opportunities in the U.S. onshore, most of which would be considered unconventional resources plays. As such, these assets require access to water for drilling and completions operations. Without an adequate supply of water, Anadarko and/or its suppliers would need to develop alternatives, allocate capital to other assets in its portfolio, and/or consider reducing the level of activity in a given play. The threshold amount of change necessary will differ among operational plays based upon the economics involved with the required change. These considerations are a significant part of our investment, engagement and water-management strategies to ensure adequate supplies of and appropriate disposal of water at all of our U.S. onshore growth opportunities. Additionally, activity levels are evaluated continuously as part of our budget process for each field. During the budget process, potential changes in operations and costs, including water availability, management and disposal, are considered.
We rate our risk based on a measure of probability versus severity. A substantial ("substantive change") risk would be one that: - has a high level of probability, meaning most key factors contributing to the risk are present.  There may be deficiencies in controls or procedures currently in place.  Historically, the event has occurred with some frequency within Aptar or the industry.  The event is considered likely to occur once every 1-5 years.- has a high level of severity, meaning the potential impact on cash flow and earnings is material and will directly impact Aptar’s ability to meet strategic business objectives.  Quantified as impacts of $10 million or more.We rank probability and severity from 0 (low) - 10 (high). Per this heat map, a "substantive change" would be an item that:-has severity 3.5 - 6.5 and probability of 6.5 or greater;-has probability of 3.5 - 6.5 and severity of 6.5 or greater;-or has a severity and a probability of greater than 6.5

AVY defines substantive change as impacts on revenue, stakeholders and costs as well as availability of purchased goods. Indicators and amount of these changes we recognize as substantive changes include 5% revenue, concerns expressed by key stakeholders, and cost increases as much as 5% (or significant risk of material availability). Any one of these elements or a combination thereof would be basis for evaluating mitigating measures. These elements impact both direct operations and supply chain.

For the purposes of previous CDP reports, any long-term or medium-term deviation with a magnitude of greater than $200 M cash flow impact or 10% of the life of mine (LOM) key parameters, such as production rate, waste management, and increase in capital/operational cost etc., were considered substantive change.  In the reporting year of 2015, our risk assessment process has become more robust and is now considering more components beyond dollar factors and has now advanced to include the following.  Mining operations generally requires years of exploration, engineering design, environmental impact study, permit application and construction to be developed. Once constructed, every operation follows a LOM plan that schedules the annual production rate, waste management and environmental remediation etc. from operation to closure and post closure. We consider a wide range of risk factors in our corporate level risk monitoring and assessment, aligning strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge in order to evaluate and manage uncertainties the company faces.Risks are understood and evaluated using the Barrick qualitative risk analysis process, including cash flow impact, life-of-mine key parameters, such as production rate, waste management, and increase in capital/operational cost etc. License to operate components are also included in the assessment. Environmental risks could trigger water related consequences. Barrick´s Water Conservation Standard requires each operation and site to perform a water risk assessment on an annual basis. As part of this exercise, in 2015, the risk thresholds were reviewed in light of developments in the business to ensure they are meaningful, and amended as appropriate.  Barrick is also developing a comprehensive Water Management Framework to support assessment and mitigation of water related risks, including consideration of:  -	Water Location-	Water Scarcity-	Environmental Impacts to water-	Regulatory compliance on water-	Water Quality-	Water Quantity-	Water Management on Closure-	Community perception

Water risks are considered as part of business continuity planning, and uses threshold criteria established by that program.  In the reporting year, no significant water risks have been identified. We continue to monitor water risk through regular activities performed by BD's Office of Global Sustainability.Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency & distribution of storms.  While any one weather event is not tied to climate change, BD is experiencing weather impacts on its operations, including some site closures as a result of severe weather. We have manufacturing sites all over the world. In some instances, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. Weather, natural disasters (including pandemics), political change, failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products, resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customersClimate change is predicted to increase droughts in certain regions that are dependent on hydropower or in areas where high quality water is required for operations. We have already seen some price increases in areas such as Brazil.  This may increase the cost of electricity if low water reservoirs require switching to another form of energy that is more expensive.  Additionally, water costs may increase in certain areas if droughts are prolonged and/or severe.

At Best Buy, we use an ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System (EMS) in our U.S. operations to systematically identify, prioritize, manage and review environmental aspects. Through the use of our EMS, we are able to systematically assess and continuously improve our environmental initiatives, goals, compliance matters, and ultimately reduce our environmental impact.  Water was not categorized as a high priority because our water use per square foot is minimal. In our company-owned or managed facilities, water use is primarily limited to these fixture types: water closets, urinals, lavatory faucets and kitchen sinks. In most facilities, Best Buy is a tenant and water used for irrigation purposes is controlled and operated by the property owners. Our water is supplied and treated by local municipalities. As a retailer, our water impacts are de minimis. Through the use of our EMS, we ensure compliance with all regulatory frameworks regarding water—specifically storm water permits.In addition, in 2015 the Best Buy Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability team conducted a sustainability assessment. The assessment identified environmental and social topics based on analysis of interviews and surveys with internal business partners and key external stakeholders. Our analysis determined e-waste, climate change, responsible sourcing, and sustainable products are among the top sustainability priorities for our company. Water use in our operations is de minimis and not considered material.

A substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risks would be characterized by a disruption of a potable water supply substantial enough to warrant shutting down any aspect of our manufacturing process.  As our manufacturing process is highly regimented, delay at any stage due to a water shortage has the potential to require the entire batch to be discarded for quality and safety concerns. Additionally, some of our suppliers are under similar constraints and substantial shutdowns for them could impact our material supplies, thus restricting our operations.

We follow an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process that encompasses our entire company to identify, assess, prioritize and address major risks on an ongoing basis.  ERM addresses the full spectrum of risks: market/environmental, compliance, legal, strategic, financial/operational and reputational.  When a significant risk is identified based on internal financial thresholds and other criteria, the process includes the development, implementation and monitoring of risk mitigation strategies and reporting. Within ERM, we define Business Continuity Management as a holistic management process that identifies lower-probability significant events, including those resulting from climate change-related events such as the increased frequency or severity of weather conditions, including hurricanes, typhoons or tornados.The Audit Committee of our Board participates in regular reviews of our ERM process to assess and manage enterprise risks, including those related to market/environmental, strategic, financial, operational, legal, compliance and reputational risks. In addition, each of the other standing Board Committees regularly meet to discuss the short-term and long-term objectives and provide oversight for risks related to the applicable committee’s areas of responsibility.  As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight as part of its fiduciary duty of care to effectively monitor business operations. Our Board administers its risk oversight function as a whole and through its Committees.  The asset or operational responsibility for these areas is delegated to the senior executive level.

Brown-Forman evaluates many variables in determining substantive change of our business and operations. One such variable is the overall availability of water for use in our direct operations. Globally, our company faces some direct risk associated with water scarcity because of the location of our operations and the requirements for water in our production processes and finished products. This risk stems from constraints on the available quantity, quality, and cost of water supplies across our enterprise but especially from a minority of our operations located in certain sensitive areas.Furthermore, a number of our key ingredients are agricultural based and are also dependent upon the availability of water. Any change in water dynamics, including water stress or even flooding, could cause supply disruptions or alterations in our supplier arrangements. This would result in cost increases for Brown-Forman. Also within our supply chain, we utilize co-packers for final completion of products. These facilities, while outside our operational control, rely upon abundant amounts of high quality water to carry out their services. Any disruption to their operations could impact the production and delivery of products.Weather, the effects of climate change, diseases, and other agricultural uncertainties that affect the mortality, health, yield, quality, or price of the various raw materials used in our products also present risks for our business, including in some cases potential impairment in the recorded value of our inventory. Changes in weather patterns or intensity can substantively disrupt our supply chain as well, which may affect production operations, insurance costs and coverage, as well as the timely delivery of our products to customers.Water is one of the major components of our products, so the quality and quantity of available water is important to our ability to operate our business. If droughts become more common or severe, or if our water supply were interrupted for other reasons, high-quality water could become scarce in some key production regions for our products, including Tennessee, Kentucky, California, Canada, and Mexico.

Changes in weather patterns or intensity can substantively disrupt our supply chain as well, which may affect production operations, insurance costs and coverage, as well as the timely delivery of our products to customers.Water is one of the major components of our products, so the quality and quantity of available water is important to our ability to operate our business. If droughts become more common or severe, or if our water supply were interrupted for other reasons, high-quality water could become scarce in some key production regions for our products, including Tennessee, Kentucky, California, Canada, and Mexico.

While Bunge has not defined a numerical threshold for what constitutes a substantive risk related to water, material impacts to the company’s financial results may stem from three types of risk:Our sugar production depends on the volume and sucrose content of the sugarcane that we cultivate or that is supplied to us by third-party growers. Both sugarcane crop yields and sucrose content depend significantly on weather conditions, such as rainfall and prevailing temperatures.  As such, unfavorable weather conditions have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our sugar operations.Adverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, reduce demand for our fertilizer products and negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us.Severe adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or flooding, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries and other loss and damage to us. Our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services. A disruption in transportation services, as a result of weather conditions or otherwise, may also significantly adversely impact our operations.

We realize that water risks could cause a substantive change in our business.  First, our operations could be affected if we had to shut down our manufacturing facilities due to a lack of water.  This would significantly impact our revenues.  Next, if water related risks impact our suppliers, we could either be impacted by not being able to obtain enough ingredients to make our products or have to pay a higher price for them.  At the end of the day, both of these things would have a negative impact on our revenues.

One of our operations in British Columbia is exposed if there is a drought situation that limits our ability to use water for the manufacture of our paper products.  Climate change has impacted the region and we are experience wide variations in winter snow pack and wide variations in summer precipitation.
We define substantive change by risks to water that materially impact our business, operations, revenue or expenditure in a negative way for a significant period of time that would prevent us from carrying on normal operations and manufacturing activities to make and ship our products to customers. A substantive scenario could lead to reduced business in the mid-term, reduction in revenue, and increase expenditures to cope with realized risk time periods.
Potential substantive changes to Celgene’s business and operations from water risks (see complete list below) are related to those that can contribute to a change in our business operations and impact costs related to water resources (withdrawal and discharge) and meeting regulatory requirements. This can also include any change or risk in water availability or quality utilized at our facility for operational use or employee consumption. This definition for substantive change is only applied to Celgene’s direct operations; another definition that relates to Celgene’s supply chain has yet to be formulated and applied.

Cisco defines substantive change as either affecting publicly reported financial results, changes to existing enterprise risk assessment results requiring mitigating action, or impacting component or product availability to the extent customer shipments or schedule are impacted. Cisco quantifies substantive change as having an impact on revenue greater than $0.5B USD or having an impact on operational costs greater than $200M USD. This definition applies to both our direct operations and supply chain and is reviewed and updated on an annual basis as part of Cisco's broader enterprise risk management (ERM) process conducted by Cisco's internal audit organization.

Clorox has enterprise risk management processes to identify, assess and prioritize business risks. Clorox uses a systematic process to evaluate risks. The process includes identifying risks, assessing exposures and quantifying the value at risk to the company. The evaluation considers level of potential impact, the overall vulnerability to an event based on the time and our capacity to react and adapt, and the likelihood of an occurrence.While severe regional weather events have the potential to disrupt our operations, or that of our customers and/or suppliers, we believe our dispersed supply chain affords us redundancy, which mitigates risk to our business from localized events. Additionally, Clorox engages in engineering loss-prevention strategies aimed at reducing the risk of natural and accidental hazards and each location has backup power supply for critical functions. The company’s manufacturing locations have comprehensive emergency response plans and most locations have business continuity plans. The company’s headquarters also has an emergency response plan with trained floor wardens, established evacuation procedures and business continuity plans for critical functions. We believe the location of our facilities limit threats from rising ocean levels.
Consumers Energy defines a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure for water risk as any change that would dramatically affect our operation reliability, costs or reputation.  The definition applies to direct operations. Specific levels of change or numeric metrics of change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure for water are not established.  Electricity markets are complex and based on many factors, including the relative cost of electricity within an established organization, often covering several states.  The organization is approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to coordinate, control and monitor the use of the electric transmission system by utilities, generators and marketers.
While we have completed individual water risk assessments at the facility level, we cannot determine at this time if they will have a substantive change in our business operations, revenue or expenditures.
Colgate uses an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program to identify, assess, prioritize and manage physical risks. The ERM Committee is sponsored by the Chairman, President and CEO of the Company and includes representation from key internal business leaders.  Risks are collectively identified across the organization and are classified within the Strategic, Financial, Operational, Information Technology, Legal & Compliance and Emerging Risk Categories.  Each Risk Category is assigned an owner who is also a member of the ERM Committee and who is ultimately accountable for successfully managing the identified risk.  The Natural Disaster ERM - addresses the physical risks associated with water and climate change that could disrupt our commercial and supply chain operations.   Colgate also has a formal process to identify critical suppliers (e.g. high volume suppliers, suppliers of critical materials, non-substitutable formulas). Every year we update our segmentation strategies where we classify materials and suppliers according to the criticality of the material segment as well as the market complexity and buyer power using a matrix tool. Selected agricultural materials that are impacted by change in precipitation extremes and droughts are considered in this process. Risk management plans including changes in source of supply and potential alternative formulations are in place.For purposes of this survey, we used a screening criteria to identify sites meeting the CDP guidance for "substantive" as follows: 1) sites indicated as "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk per WRI Aqueduct, and 2) which are either considered strategic sites or those which account for >2% of global production volume.This threshold is evaluated annually, when the Aqueduct tool is used to evaulate water risk. The Global Sustainability and EHS group engages with local sites to evaluate the threshold based on both the Aqueduct tool and more short-term and local conditions and events.

For this section, we are only responding as The Coca-Cola Company, not suppliers, independent or franchise bottling partners, or other entities that are not part of Company manufacturing operations. For our business, CDP’s term of ‘substantive’ is better termed “materiality.’ As a large, global business, materiality is a high threshold in terms of impacts to operations, expenses and revenue. As stated in our most recent filing with the SEC on February 25, 2016: "Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require water, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change. As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints that could adversely affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run."

Water-related risks are particularly relevant to the food industry, with a global supply chain intensely dependent on the availability of clean water to grow ingredients. Managing water risk — both at our own facilities and those embedded in our supply chain — is critical to ConAgra Foods’ long-term business success. To determine whether these water-related risks have potential to generate a substantive change in our business operations, revenue or expenditures, we've applied US Securities Exchange Commission materiality principles, considering both quantitative and qualitative impacts.  The risk analysis factors in both the probability of the risk and estimated financial implications.  For this purpose material risks generating substantive change to our business would be changes affecting more than 5% of our revenue or assets.

In defining substantive change to our business, Operations, revenues or expenditures from water risk, Constellation considers both the magnitude of potential loss, and the likelihood of the risk.  For the purposes of this report, we define substantive change as the potential loss of 5% of our global production volume as well as the potential loss of 5% in each segment of our business (beer vs. wine & spirits). This percentage may vary slightly year to year. This metric includes only our direct Operations and not our supply chain.

Cummins uses a multi-pronged approach to evaluating risks and opportunities and determining if they are substantive to our business: 	Cummins Business Continuity Planning function prioritizes and addresses key risks of which water related issues are one component. Cummins developed a detailed cause and effect (C&E) matrix to prioritize our sites combining multiple factors including: 1) the site’s self-assessment of water risk from a survey on source water sustainability, quality, discharge, regulatory, and cost considerations addressing both current and future (2017 and beyond) conditions, 2) the size and complexity of the site, 3) the presence or absence of water supply assessments, 4) and watershed-specific water stress indicators.  For water stress indicators, Cummins worked with an external consultant to develop a composite picture of current and future water stress by combining data from WRI Aqueduct Tool, WBCSD Global Water Tool, and consultant expertise in the countries/regions where we operate. Portions of this data extend to a 2025 planning horizon.  Scoring and weighting factors were applied to each of the 4 components of the C&E matrix and an ‘at risk’ threshold was defined as any sites scoring 150 or above in total composite score. Based upon these results, Cummins conducted detailed watershed assessments at each of the 3 locations scoring above the 150 ‘at risk’ threshold, recently we added two more sites.  BFCEC due to its growth that raised the risk scoring and CBL due to specific water issues arising in the area. In addition to the watershed assessments over 20 site level audits have been conducted to further validate conditions at prioritized sites.  These audits and assessments identified specific areas for water management improvements including conservation, risk management, and community/watershed engagement opportunities.Facility data and conditions are reviewed annually and may alter the priority sites form year to year, but a formal risk assessment using the full cause and effect matrix tool is planned to be conducted every 5 years.A six sigma project identified 264 critical suppliers. The water risk using the Maplecroft tool has been analyzed for each of these suppliers.  Select suppliers will be required to submit a risk mitigation plan as a results of their scores

To generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenues, or expenditures, any particular event or change would have to impact either a wide range of product lines or a large swath of our stores. Because of the wide geographical diversity and the many diverse product lines that we sell, an impact on any one store or product line would not substantively impact the company as a whole.

As stated in our 2015 fiscal year 10-K, John Deere's business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment.  This may include water related items such as timing and quantity of rainfall, excessive rain, flooding and drought conditions. Due to the variability and uncertainty of weather conditions affecting our customers globally, for the purposes of this CDP response we are focused on our direct operations, and the water risk attributes of water scarcity and volume. Using the WRI Aqueduct Tool, we define substantive change from water risk in terms of water scarcity and volume for those manufacturing and distribution operations currently sited in regions defined as having a baseline water stress of  extremely high stress, moderately high stress, high stress and moderate stress considering a projected change over 20 years. We also determine if these sites are considered strategic meaning they account for >2% of global production volume. If both criteria are met, then these sites could pose a substantive change in our business, operations or revenue.

Our process for defining and identifying substantive changes is the same process used to establish Strategic Growth Plans (SGPs), annual objectives, and monthly/quarterly priorities. At the enterprise level, we also utilize a risk assessment process to identify and track significant business risks.We develop strategic plans and associated initiatives based on annual input from business unit leaders, market research and analysis, as well as external and functional expertise. At the enterprise level, a strategic framework provides direction for refining business unit strategies. In developing our strategic objectives, we endeavor to identify any opportunities or risks (financial, regulatory, capability, etc.) that would improve or impede our ability to achieve our objectives.Further, the capital budgeting process includes criteria for sustainability and water related risks and opportunities.

Dell's largest water risk is associated with supply chain disruption caused by climate change and other water hazards. These disruptions cause loss in revenue from loss of availability and increase in operations costs as alternative suppliers are utilized at greater costs. A risk that we are continuing to focus on is water scarcity. Much of Dell's water consumption is based around municipal use, so we have chosen to focus on water consumption in water stressed regions. The water consumption is already relatively low, and we would like to take the opportunity to protect our reputation as a responsible resource consumer.

The impact of environmental regulations is considered during Diebold's annual Risk Assessment. Regulatory impacts to our business are considered from a cost of compliance, reputational impacts, loss of business, and the potential for financial penalties. Environmental impact due to pollution and other environmental conditions is rated on a risk impact scale. Regional and Country stewards, numbering more than 100, of the Global Sustainability and Social Responsibility team coordinate and review risks and opportunities related to climate change at the facility level. The results of the annual Risk Assessment are reported to the Diebold Leadership Team, and the Diebold Corporate Responsibility Advisory Council.

We publish information about the Company’s activities, including water-related risks, in official filings.  For example, we addressed water-related issues in our 2015 Form 10-K Annual Report to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Water-related issues included in the Form 10-K are those that are determined to be information that a reasonable investor would attach importance in determining whether to buy, hold, or sell Dominion securities.  For the purpose of the Water CDP, we are defining water risks that could generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure as those issues identified in our 2015 Form 10-K Annual Report.
As stated in our annual 10-K filing, weather, climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business.We may be faced with water availability risks. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. Climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate, and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.

The majority of our operations and supply chain takes place in Michigan, which has an abundant fresh water supply.  Although the risks to our company are low at this time, the risks are expected to increase in the future(e.g. as regulations continue to change and challenge our industry ).  An example of a substantive change would be legislation or a physical change in supply that would reduce our ability to withdraw the amount of water needed to produce adequate amount of electricity for our customers.
DuPont defines substantive change in terms of the SEC definition for materiality. What constitutes “material” must be judged from the viewpoint of a reasonably prudent investor making a decision to buy, hold or sell stock. An item is considered material, if in the light of surrounding circumstances, the magnitude of the item is such that it is probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the item. DuPont does not believe it has any material water risks.  In item 1A of our annual 10-K, we do identify unpredictable seasonal and weather factors as a risk that could impact sales and earnings from the company’s Agriculture segment.  Weather factors such as droughts or changing precipitation patterns could impact the agriculture sector in a number of ways.

We employ a multifaceted process to determine our company’s material issues in order to align materiality with our company and customers’ key business drivers. Ecolab’s annual enterprise “Assessment of Significant Business Risks” provides the foundation for assessing the materiality of issues to our business. The annual assessment is conducted using a survey tool designed to identify strategic, operational, financial and compliance-related risks to the company. Risks are documented along with the likelihood and impact of their occurrence. An audit-services vice president manages the process, and the results are presented to the executive committee and Ecolab board of directors. The most significant, and therefore substantive business risks are reported publicly through the company’s annual 10-K filing.Using the Assessment of Significant Business Risks as a foundation, we undertook a rigorous process to analyze risks and opportunities specific to sustainability in 2013 and revisit this work bi-annualy. We embarked on a strategic approach to better understand and measure against the issues that present material risks and opportunities to our company as they align with the interests of our stakeholders (primarily customers) but we also engage a diverse set of stakeholders to assess the materiality of sustainability-specific issues including employees, customers, investors and relevant external groups.Substantive change to our business as it relates to water risk is based upon an assessment of water risks at our direct manufacturing operations related to our production volume where it can effect greater than 10% of our direction operations and facilities by production. This definition does not yet apply to our supply chain. This assessment and its criteria are reviewed annually and incorporated into our annual business risk assessment and reporting processes.

We define a substantive change as any water-related impact that results in material reduction or stoppage in production and/or revenue at our sites, or a large change in expenditures relating to water sourcing, treatment and management.
In our business, bulk active ingredient manufacturing sites use the largest amounts of water followed by final dosage finishing sites. Packaging sites require very little water and present less risk to the organization. In our Global Supply Chain, we already take into account manufacturing issues that could shut down bulk active ingredient sites for 6 to 10 months, drug final dosage finishing manufacturing for 2 to 3 months and packaging for 1 to 2 months.  We use inventory management practices as a primary risk mitigation strategy. An extreme water stress event (i.e. a drought that provided a moratorium on water use for many months) would have to extend beyond these periods for there to be a potential economic impact on Lilly. Our Global Supply Chain area also works with our Treasury area and an external consultant to develop scenarios of "catastrophic" events (i.e. a manufacturing site being "destroyed"). We determined that a drought/water disruption scenario would have to extend for a long period of time (i.e. several years) to cause a substantive change to our business. Given these conditions and our product mix, we made a determination that extended periods of drought should not significantly impact our business. Costs associated with these analyses are embedded in operating budgets and are not disclosed.

In our Global Supply Chain, we already take into account manufacturing issues that could shut down bulk active ingredient sites for 6 to 10 months, drug final dosage finishing manufacturing for 2 to 3 months and packaging for 1 to 2 months.  We use inventory management practices as a primary risk mitigation strategy. An extreme water stress event (i.e. a drought that provided a moratorium on water use for many months) would have to extend beyond these periods for there to be a potential economic impact on Lilly. Our Global Supply Chain area also works with our Treasury area and an external consultant to develop scenarios of "catastrophic" events (i.e. a manufacturing site being "destroyed"). We determined that a drought/water disruption scenario would have to extend for a long period of time (i.e. several years) to cause a substantive change to our business. Given these conditions and our product mix, we made a determination that extended periods of drought should not significantly impact our business. Costs associated with these analyses are embedded in operating budgets and are not disclosed.

Operational risks are defined as the risk of loss or lost opportunity resulting from the following: reserves and resources replacement, capital activities and operating activities. Encana's ability to operate, generate cash flows, complete projects, and value reserves and resources is subject to many risks including the ability to access water for hydraulic fracturing operations.
Substantive change is defined as impacting the economic viability of an operational area or facility, triggering a new evaluation of whether the facility is a net asset or liability.  For instance, if the cash flows no longer exceed the anticipated abandonment or the cumulative positives are less than the book value (up front capital), there may be net loss.Metrics used to determine substantive change include: proved reserves, annual production, net income, cashflow, fixed and variable operational costs, finding and development costs and capital efficiencies.  These metrics are reviewed annually.  Due to variable economic parameters, specific thresholds used to determine substantiveness vary by operational area. Enerplus defines substantive applicable to direct operation only.

Substantive change could be a cooling water system retrofit, if mandated by the permitting authority.  A substantive change could also be the potential for shareholder or customer concern, or a combination resulting in a larger impact.  The basis for expressing the percentage of operation affected is based on plants identified using WRI AqueDuct risk mapping plus our own plant-specific information.  The calculation is: total net generation MWh of the facilities located in water stress regions divided by the total net generation MWh produced by the generation facilities over which Exelon has operational control.  This percentage does not include operations related to the marketing and distribution of energy or natural gas, which have less significant water uses. Exelon Corporation compiles an enterprise-wide inventory of water withdrawals and associated discharges annually. Exelon used the WRI AqueDuct to screen for potential geographic water scarcity.  All facilities identified in the screening process as being potentially located in water scarce areas were further evaluated using internal company knowledge and regional basin management information to confirm the model output.  The WRI AqueDuct uses twelve global maps grouped into physical risk quantity, quality, and regulatory and reputational risk. The seven physical quantity risks include: baseline water stress; inter-annual variability; seasonal variability; floods; drought severity; upstream storage and groundwater. Physical water quality risks include return flow ratio and upstream protected land.  The three regulatory and reputational risks include media coverage, access to water and threatened amphibians.   Overall water risk assessment identifies areas with higher exposure to these water-related risks and is an aggregated measure.  In the past Exelon used the UNEP water stress map: http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/jpg/0221-waterstress-EN.jpg which shows that Exelon has no operations in water stressed areas based on the UNEP definition, i.e., less than 1700 cubic meters per person per year.  WRI’s new AqueDuct assessment tool is far more broad in its definition of water stress; and therefore we have identified some areas where we operate that are subject to water stress as defined in the multivariate analyses WRI uses in their AqueDuct tool.

Our analysis of Ford operations shows that some of our facilities are located in regions where water supplies are already scarce. Global climate change also has the potential to further impact the quality and availability of water. We cannot be certain that we will always have access to water of the quantity and quality that our operations require. Our water strategy puts primary emphasis on our plants located in areas of water scarcity. Ford is committed to conserving water and using it responsibly. We will address water challenges internally within our own operations and externally in communities where we operate and throughout our supply chain. We have committed to measureable actions to support our global water strategy. In deciding which facilities and which basins concern Ford, aggregate scores from the Global Water Tool (subwatershed level) were used alongside internal knowledge of specific facilities and local watersheds. If a facility had a high risk or projected risk by the tools, it was listed. The operating facilities listed as “substantive” had to have a high stress or risk and have a production or support production of greater than 1% of global relevant production (vehicle, engines, or transmissions). This definition of risk applies to Ford’s direct operations.  For supply chain, we utilized a different methodology to determine water risks that could generate a potential impact to our supply chain. Suppliers are selected to participate in the CDP Supply Chain water questionnaire based on a combination of factors including those that supply water-intensive commodities, those with operations in water-stressed areas (as determined using the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and Maplecroft tool), and the business relationship to Ford. We repeat our assessment of selected suppliers in light of developments in these three areas on an annual basis. The ongoing data obtained through the CDP surveys has helped us identify “hotspots” for GHG emissions and water use. These suppliers have been targeted to participate in the Partnership for a Cleaner Environment (PACE) program whereby Ford will share leading practices for water use reductions with these suppliers to reduce our collective environmental footprint.

Substantive changes from water risks in our supply chain include those that could have a substantial impact on our business results or reputation with key stakeholders. These could include disruptions in our ability to source products or increases in product costs due to risks such as water scarcity, quality, pollution, drought or flooding. They could also include reputation risks due to the impact of water-related risks that affect the well-being of the people who make our clothes or local communities. These reputation risks could adversely affect consumers' perceptions of our brands and lead to lower demand for our products.

We perform an ongoing assessment of a variety of risks impacting our business.  As part of that process, we consider potential financial impacts over the near term and longer time horizons.  Our risk analysis includes potential costs associated with increased or volatile commodity prices (and other related costs) resulting from water risks as well as risk of water supply restrictions to facilities.  Risks are evaluated based on the total financial impact relative to the size of our business and the likelihood of those risks coming to fruition.
GM has a Chief Risk Officer that reports both to the CFO as well as to the Board of Directors.  The CRO is responsible for GM’s enterprise and operational risk management plan and processes including identifying and assessing Company and asset level risks.  GM’s risk and opportunities identification process is as follows: - Executives from GM’s various functions and geographic locations have been appointed as risk officers- Annually, these risk officers identify, evaluate and assess various Company and asset risks and opportunities. Risk officers review results with their respective Executive Leadership Team (ELT)(i) Company level Risks and opportunities are categorized as Tier 1, 2 or 3 based on frequency, how quickly they may materialize, and on their potential impact to the company.  Impact may be measured by a number of variables - reputation, operations, revenue, etc.  - All Tier 1 have approved mitigation plans, and are reviewed in detail regularly by the ELT and by the Board.  - All Tier 2 risks have approved mitigation plans and are reviewed at least once a year by the ELT and by the BOD.  - All Tier 3 risks have been fully analysed, put on a “watch list” and are regularly reviewed by CRO and the respective ELT member.(ii) Water Risks identified as Asset level risks have mitigation plans that are responsibility of day-to-day management.  Exposure to and experience with catastrophic risk or losses related to water are continuously analyzed and reviewed for ongoing operations and when evaluating new sites and supplier selection. Asset level risks are generally those that are anticipated to occur with regular or high frequency, but have an overall low impact on the Company and can be absorbed by the reserves on the annual balance sheet.  Lessons learned are incorporated into future site planning, supplier selection process, and risk mitigation planning and strategic development.While the risks related to water at individual GM facilities is not substantive in total to GM, our operations in Mexico, especially in San Luis Potosi, Silao, and Ramos Arizpe have water risks that cause GM to substantially modify our operating plans since the risk is substantive at a local level.  This includes additional spending for Zero Liquid Discharge and other levels of water reuse to minimize the impact to the local community and GM's operations.

In the context of the CDP Water response, Goodyear interprets a substantive change as the inability to manufacture tires in accordance with Goodyear's long-term strategy. This relates to direct operations and the measure would include the prevention of growing production by one tire or more, meaning any growth prevented directly by water-related issues. This metric is reviewed annually as a part of the global water risk assessment and is included in the overall water risk assessment plans.

Substantive risks to our direct operations are those that impact our ability to successfully deliver products to our customers in a timely manner. Risks are prioritized based on severity and probability, allowing us to focus on those risks that are the most likely to have a considerable financial impact.
Substantive change is defined as change that could materially impact revenues or costs. For example by curtailing operations such as hydraulic fracturing, or by restricting access to a crucial supply chain input such as fresh water or guar.

A substantive change is defined by Caesars as any risk that may impose one or more of the following: 1) physical damage, 2) increased regulatory constraints, or 3) impacts to operations, services, and revenues. The following thresholds have been identified for each type of substantive change: 1) a repair or replacement costing Caesars more than $25k -- the threshold for capital funds approval 2) any regulatory constraints that prohibit the use of our swimming pools, golf courses or impact the availability of water to provide fully-functioning WASH services, 3) an interruption in utility service, or one day of lost revenue at any Caesars property. This definition is inclusive of indirect impacts to operations, services and revenue through the supply chain. If a reduction in supply impacts menus for more than 5 business days, this would be considered substantive. If suppliers and alternative suppliers increase the cost of their goods or services by 8%, this would be considered substantive. Any amount of negative media attention would be considered substantive, as negative media attention will negatively affect the Caesars brand.  We assess sites at risk every year and determine which of these thresholds maybe in peril according to the WRI aqueduct tool and each sites water use.  Additionally groups throughout the organization review each threshold on a regular basis as part of their responsibilities.

HWI is subject to a multitude of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth. Stated examples of water-related risks include: (1) climate change or availability of natural resources; (2) natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, volcanic eruptions, oil spills and nuclear incidents; (3) changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel.  HWI defines substantive risk as the substantial destruction of certain of our iconic and most profitable owned hotel assets. In its 2015 10-K, HWI acknowledges that certain properties may qualify as legally-permissible nonconforming uses and improvements, including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties. If a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty, we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists, regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds. Any loss of this nature, whether insured or not, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects. However, it is important to emphasize that Hilton Worldwide is highly diversified from a global perspective.  Out of 4600 Hilton Worldwide properties, a total of 695 hotels are under HWI’s direct operational control (owned, leased, joint venture or managed by Hilton Management Services).  Of these properties, Hilton has an ownership interest in 146 hotels and a controlling financial interest in only 56 of these hotels, with the majority located in the US (75%) and UK (14%).  Thus, our ownership interest only accounts for approximately 1.2% of hotels worldwide and 8% of hotels under HWI’s direct operational control (owned and managed). This is why our global sustainability program and risk mitigation strategy has been focused on driving water efficiency through participation in LightStay and the Brand Standards, with compliance required for all owned, managed and franchised hotels worldwide.

Husky's enterprise risk management program supports decision-making via comprehensive and systematic identification and assessment of risks that could materially impact the results of the Company. Through this framework, the Company builds risk management and mitigation into strategic planning and operational processes for its business units through the adoption of standards and best practices. Husky has developed an enterprise risk matrix to identify risks to its people, the environment, its assets and its reputation, and to systematically mitigate these risks to an acceptable level. Husky defines substantive change as having a financial impact of greater than ten (10) million dollars.The corporate risk register is revisited on at least an annual basis, while the matrix is evaluated every three years.

Based on the nature and scope of our business operations and  our interaction with suppliers, IBM does not perceive any unusual water-related risks in our operations or the supply chain outside of those we plan for as part of our ongoing business and risk management processes. These risk management processes look at business risk comprehensively including, but not limited to, risks and impacts related to water use and discharge. We anticipate that the business models of both IBM’s and our production and service suppliers’ operations will enable those operations to anticipate and adapt to potential risks and mitigate the impacts without significant disruptions to our business. This risk management approach is primarily achieved through implementation of the IBM global Environmental Management System, established for over 40 years, which is integrated into our business operations.

Intel’s Board of Directors and management consider “risk” for these purposes to be the possibility that an undesired event could occur that might adversely affect the achievement of our objectives. Risks vary in many ways, including the ability of the company to anticipate and understand the risk, the types of adverse impacts that could occur if the undesired event occurs, the likelihood that an undesired event and a particular adverse impact would occur, and the ability of the company to control the risk and the potential adverse impacts. The types of risks that Intel faces include:• Macro-economic risks such as inflation, reductions in economic growth, or recession• Political risks such as restrictions on access to markets, confiscatory taxation, and expropriation of assets• “Event” risks such as natural disasters• Business-specific risks related to strategic position, operational execution, financial structure, legal and regulatory compliance, corporate governance, and environmental stewardshipNot all risks can be dealt with in the same way. Some risks may be easily perceived and controllable, while others are unknown; some risks can be avoided or mitigated by a particular behavior; and some risks are unavoidable as a practical matter. In some cases, a higher degree of risk may be acceptable because of a greater perceived potential for reward.

When risks hit certain material thresholds or causes substantive change, such as a certain dollar value impact to EBIT or sudden/instantaneous onset of impact, the committee reports those risks to company management and the board of directors.Juniper prioritizes risks found to be material. Materiality of an issue is assessed as follows:• The value, or risk, of the issue to business operations: Using our corporate strategy, Juniper looks at whether the issue represents a significant risk or opportunity to our company or industry? Is it current or emerging? Is it already part of the Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability strategy or does it need to be added? • The priority of the issue to our stakeholders: Does this issue resonate with our key stakeholders? Is it a subject of NGO campaigns? How does it track in the media? Is it reflected in pending legislation, regulations, or international agreements?• Peers & competitors: Do Juniper’s peers and competitors disclose against this issue? How do they respond?• Juniper’s influence over the issue: To what extent does Juniper have control or influence over the issue through our direct actions, industry associations, or networks?• Relevant and applicable voluntary global reporting and corporate social responsibility standards and guidelines: Is the issue addressed by the standard disclosures of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct, or by other relevant and applicable global voluntary standards?Juniper’s approach to materiality is aligned with the domain solutions & customer verticals of our business strategy. The strategy provides a structure & hierarchy for prioritizing the value, or risk, of an issue on Juniper’s business operations. It is based on the following approach: Is this issue critical to our customer segments (Telecom, Financial Services, Cable/MSO, National Government, Cloud Providers & Strategic Enterprise Verticals)? Is this issue relevant to our product domains (Campus & Branch, Access & Aggregation, Edge, Core, Data Center, & Cloud Services)?

Substantive changes include plant relocation, curtailment of operations, product relocation, interruptions in availability, increased cost for municipal water, increased cost for raw materials, lack of security of supply of raw materials, and significant investment in water reduction/recycling. The metrics for this would include increase costs, lack of availability causing shut downs, and water treatment costs. The threshold for these indicators would vary from facility to facility but would be assessed against brand P & L and operational budgets. This covers both operations and supply chain.

Kimberly-Clark's tissue business is water intensive, and relies significantly on the availability of adequate supplies. We define Substantive Change as any interruption in the water supply that would directly curtail production and force the shutdown of the facility until the water supply is restored. For any expansion, or new greenfield site, the availability of adequate fresh water supply is very important. Because of this, all new expansions or new tissue machines will employ state-of-the-art water conservation technologies, and, new wastewater plants will employ the latest technology in water recycling. These efforts incur a higher expenditure than traditional technologies. The threshold for substantive change and risk is 1% or more of global production capacity, which applies to direct operations. Risk is evaluated annually and the risk mitigation plan is implemented and adjusted based on the analysis. Since water reporting began, there have been no water-related business or operational issues greater than the 1% production threshold.

Lockheed Martin considers water-related risks to be location specific and does not deem water to pose a material impact, or "substantive change," to enterprise-wide direct business operations, revenue or expenditure currently or within the next 3 years. For the purposes of Water CDP disclosure, we define substantive change from water-related risks as those that are present within certain regions where we or key suppliers operate that could lead to deviations from normal business operations (e.g., increased process time, disrupted material flow, supply chain delay, etc.) and/or a change in revenue or costs to the affected facility and/or supplier caused by a water shortage, regulatory water restriction, water-related natural catastrophe, or other water-related impact.Lockheed Martin selects sites that could contribute to substantive change to our business by using a screening process as follows: 1) Identify sites indicated as “High” or “Extremely High” overall water risk using our combined risk score of the WBCSD Global Water risk tool score, water use ranking, and local/regional consultant risk score and then 2) Cross check whether these sites are considered mission critical because they house production for key programs. This process applies to both our direct operations and our supply chain.

While the scale and geographic diversification of our business makes it unlikely that localized water risks could generate a substantive change in our overall business, we regularly evaluate some of the more prevalent and pressing water risks that do impact properties in our managed portfolio and present that information below.  Even if these risks do not currently have the potential to reduce our revenue by more than 5%, they impact the communities in which we operate and the health and safety of our associates. We not only comply with regulatory action but also strive to help address these issues where possible. We report them here, even without comprehensive facility-level data that is not feasible to include.

We conduct a process to understand how water risk is impacting our site network. In January and February each year, all our production sites complete a series of questions related to watershed governance and water issues experienced. We assess these responses and identify the sites experiencing the greatest water-related risks and impacts.We map sites in locations of high (>40%) baseline water stress using the WRI Aqueduct tool as a second indicator.For the first time this year, we have also begun to identify sites producing more than 5% of their business segment’s global production volume, for our Food, Wrigley, Drinks and Chocolate segments. For the Petcare segment, which has far more sites, we identify sites producing more than 2% of total volumes. We now use the proportion of production volume as an indicator of potential business impact in the event of water issues affecting a factory’s ability to operate consistently.We consider sites consistently measuring high risk on all three of the above criteria to represent a substantive water-related risk to the business, and regard them as high-priority sites for our water program. These sites will be the subject of a water stewardship review to ensure we have a detailed understanding of local water risks and opportunities. We are currently developing this process, with a pilot in progress at the Food segment’s Kings Lynn site in the UK. We aim to complete this review at high-priority locations before year-end 2020, and at all new production sites from 2017 onward.In our supply chain, we have overlaid our raw material origins with watersheds, to cross-reference water-intensive crops with areas of water stress to identify priority watersheds and countries that present a substantive supply risk. We are working with the World Resources Institute to develop science-based targets for reducing water impacts, as we have done for Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions. More information on this approach is available at www.wri.org/blog/2016/04/companies-could-profit-setting-water-targets-informed-science.

Microsoft has determined that, at present, our business is not exposed to water risks that could generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue, or expenditure. Substantive change for our office, lab, and manufacturing facilities would include a requirement to significantly alter, close, and/or relocate the operations of a particular facility or group of facilities. This could include impacts on employees and/or technology equipment. Our operational analysis includes a three-part filter of all of our facilities to identify those that potentially represent the greatest risk: 1) location in water basins with high baseline water stress or the future potential for high baseline water stress; 2) annual average electricity use greater than 60 kWh per square foot (large electricity users being datacenters); and 3) if the facility represents greater than 1 percent of total companywide electricity use (using electricity as proxy for the size and/or relative importance of the facility to our company). We review our approach annually when we respond to the CDP water questionnaire and take the opportunity to reassess our risk assessment procedures and look for opportunities to formalize and integrate the various risk assessments that take place within the organization.Similarly, substantive change for our datacenters would entail the need to significantly alter, close, and/or relocate a datacenter in response to water risk that would affect our ability to deliver continuous customer services. We engage all utilities (water/sewer/power/fiber) during site selection due diligence. Capacity and quality are vetted and service agreements put in place prior to completing the transaction. Where future expansion plans are unknown, we obtain commitment letters from the utilities indicating that they can provide for future demand (often subject to expansion of existing infrastructure). We do not locate datacenters where utility constraints would prevent us from operating those facilities.This definition applies to direct operations only.

Substantive change is defined as a significant operation change or expenditure greater than $1 million. Elements of substantive change include the following:- Rapidly increasing social, political and media concern leading to project delays, increased costs- Increasing pressure on water use due to in-migration to communities in proximity to our operations leading to impacts on operations- Water scarcity and water surplus leading to production constraints and increased costs- Increasing stringent regulations focused on water management and discharge requirements leading to increased costs- Increasing financial exposure at closure due to increasingly stringent regulations and water treatment costs

Noble Energy considers a substantive change in our business as one that has the potential to adversely impact the operations or economics of development, one that could be detrimental to health, safety, environment, or one that could limit the Company’s social license to operate. A substantive change may also positively impact operations by providing substantial cost savings, implementing new technology or providing efficiencies.For example, our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by adverse weather conditions in the areas we operate including:•	hurricanes, tropical storms, cyclones, windstorms, or “superstorms” which could affect our operations in areas such as Texas, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Marcellus Shale or Eastern Mediterranean;  •	winter storms and snow which could affect our operations in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale; •	severe droughts resulting in new restrictions on water usage in the DJ Basin, Marcellus Shale and Texas; •	flooding, or increases in sea level, which could affect our operations in low-lying areas;  •	harsh weather and rough seas, which could limit certain exploration activities; and •	other natural disasters. Any of these can result in loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others, or restricted access to our properties.

We produce aluminum sheet and light gauge products for use in multiple markets, which includes beverage can.  Our single largest end-use market is beverage can sheet. The beverage market is highly dependent on fresh clean water as a key raw material, within the manufacturing process and other product ingredients.  Certain of our customers in the beverage market are significant to our revenues, and we could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of these significant customers or by the loss of their business.
NRG’s definition of substantive risk fom water is the possibility that an event will occur and significantly affect the achievement of NRG’s business goals.  Risk identification and assessment process applies to both direct operations and supply chain.NRG uses the measures, metrics and indicators for water risk assessment leveraging the management and professional judgment from the following perspectives:•Financial impact:    1)Corporate earnings   2)Capital expenditure on technologies to reduce water consumption and withdrawal •Plant operation    1)Operation disruption due to water shortage   2)Increase in costs of water usage   3)Supply chain risk•Environmental impact   1)Water availability - Higher demand for fossil fuel generation units in California in light of low hydro power may result in more  water consumption and withdrawal, further reducing water reserve in California.    3)Water quality of river basins   4)Regulations that impact supply and/or management of waterWater risk is monitored by the risk owners (individual plant operators) and reported to management upon material changes with a threshold of 20% in water consumption and withdrawal levels.  If it is determined that a water supply risk exists that could impact projected generation levels within any plant within the subsequent two year time frame, risk mitigation efforts are identified and economically evaluated for implementation.  Water risk regarding the impact for barge delivery is evaluated on a daily basis, with contingency plans developed as needed.  NRG SVP, Plant Operations reviews modelling scenarios generated for water risk determination.Plant level NRG Water usage analysis is reviewed annually.NRG water usage analysis is reviewed by the management of NRG Operations, Engineering and Commercial Operations.
We have established financial thresholds for determining 'substantive' change for the purpose of CDP reporting. These thresholds take into account direct operations and supply chain. Impacts in any given quarter of above $10M in revenue loss and/or $6M in additional Cost of Goods Sold or Operating Expenses, are considered substantive.

Oxy's HESMS and risk management approach identifies, assesses and grades significant (actual and potential) water related risks. The HESMS sets consistent worldwide performance expectations and standards across each business segment's respective operations. The HESMS facilitates compliance with laws and regulations and the management of HES and water-specific risks to improve overall business performance. Oxy manages its own water use consistent with community interests near our operations and to avoid adversely impacting the environment, or our license to operate in these communities. For example, water scarcity is a prominent issue in the Permian Basin (West Texas and Southeast New Mexico) where, as reported by the U.S. Geologic Society and Texas Alliance, the majority of oil and gas wells are in a “high or extremely high water stress area.” These prevailing water scarcity risks are factored into Oxy’s business plans and water use strategy to operationalize and mitigate risks, and also to identify and seize opportunities that could provide costs savings or generate revenues. Oxy’s form 10-K provides a detailed discussion of risk factors, including those which can be water-related such as governmental actions, climate change and catastrophic events (hurricanes, floods and droughts).

Operations at a few plants require significant quantity of water. Therefore, water related risks have the potential to cause substantial change in direct business operations. Depending on severity and the likelihood of water challenges derived from the watershed/basin, it might impact local business units as well as revenue or expenditure at global level. To determine the included facilities we identify all site listed as having "high" or "extremely high" overall water risk from the Aqueduct Tool.  We then cross reference that with our water use and production levels at each of those sites. To be considered significant the total amount of production from those sites within the basin must be above 3%.

At the enterprise level:  The Office of Compliance Assurance is responsible for the corporate risk management process and for raising awareness of key risks and reporting results directly to the Board of Director’s Audit Committee.  It is comprised of senior leaders and meets annually.  They are informed of climate-change related risks by different stakeholders within the various business units depending on the risk or opportunity considered.  As an example of a key climate-change related opportunity, product innovation is managed and monitored by the product innovation team for each business group.  These teams carefully monitor customer demands, market trends, and the regulatory landscape and incorporate trends into product development.  As an example of a key climate-change related enterprise risk from increased operational expenses from carbon regulation, the corporate energy department monitors legislation and energy use by operations, determines corporate-wide strategies on procurement, energy reduction programs and alternative energy products.  This strategy is ultimately reported to the Office of Compliance Assurance to ensure that climate-change related risks are appropriate mitigated and that opportunities are pursued.At the asset level: Each business unit assesses risks and opportunities at an asset level using ongoing systematic structures and processes.  For asset protection, each business unit is responsible for developing a business continuation plan that provides for the protection of Parker Hannifin assets. These plans are routinely audited by Parker’s Risk Management team.  For compliance, each business unit is required to stay in compliance with regulatory, internal and customer requirements.  Each business unit is routinely audited for compliance by the Parker Internal Audit team and the Environmental Health and Safety department to ensure compliance on all levels.

PG&E published the results of a third-party led materiality assessment, a project designed to help identify topics that are “material” priorities for the long-term sustainability of our business. The assessment was developed through a structured process that included interviews with internal and external stakeholders. The assessment identified “water” as one of the material topics, which was defined as “maintaining water quality and availability through company operations and ensuring the short- and long-term availability of water for other uses.”More details are available at: http://www.pgecorp.com/corp_responsibility/reports/2015/su02_materiality.jsp

In relation to substantive change, we refer to materiality - material issues are identified in a multidisciplinary way and include those which:• have the highest potential impact and a realistic probability of occurrence;• are most relevant to our enterprises and geographic locations; and• are most important to our stakeholders.In 2020+ risk forecasting terms, higher level risks are defined as those with a potential impact in excess of US$5M or a raw material impact in excess of 1000 metric tonnes of tobacco leaf.  These apply to both our direct operations and our tobacco supply chain.We have not specifically defined substantive change in relation to water risk.
APS defines substantive change to our business related to water risk in three ways.  First, a physical disruption of a water supply constitutes a substantive and disruptive change.  If a vital piece of infrastructure is damaged or becomes inoperable, output could be impacted or generation could be curtailed entirely. Second, noncompliance with a permit or regulatory requirement could impact production and/or result notices of violations and penalties. Finally, allocation cuts related to water shortages would impact production.

PotashCorp has implemented a companywide risk management framework.  The framework requires identification of risk events and assessment of such events through a risk ranking matrix (http://www.potashcorp.com/irc/company/risk/how-we-approach-risk).  Key risks or uncertainties to our operations drive our mitigation activities.  Under our risk framework the likelihood of water related risk is viewed as remote-low and the severity of consequence as negligible-low.In addition to the risk management framework, the company is structured so that it can address any unanticipated risks in a timely manner.  The company’s Executive Committee meets every other week and devotes considerable time to addressing risks.  Should the Executive Committee become aware of a significant water risk, it is positioned to develop the appropriate strategies for mitigating the risk and ensuring execution.

Substantive change from water risk is treated the same as any risk arising out of our Enterprise Risk Management process.  A substantive change is any event/trend that would materially prevent us from achieving our five year strategy.  This includes impacts to waste and recycling collection, processing, and disposal and impacts of those events on our P&L, cash flow, and balance sheets.  A "material" risk is one that conforms to the SEC materiality definition, and would thus be included in our 10-k filing, and a risk that is deemed "high" in our sustainability materiality matrix as per the GRI guidelines.  Through our ERM process we identify and develop management plans for those risks that we believe could result in a substantive change, such that the residual risk is negligible or managed.

We define substantive change from water risk in our operations to be when we have potential out of stock issues with our key wholesalers and we need to use resources to replenish our inventory levels. However, we utilize aggressive inventory control method to ensure availability of our products in the market place.

 Rockwell defines substantive change to our business to be when more than 5% of operations, revenue or expenditure is impacted, at the corporate level. This threshold is then applied to reporting water-related substantive risks. For example, if a supply-chain is disrupted as a result of prolonged drought in one region and this contributes to a reduction in production globally but it is less than 5% at the corporate level. Consequently this risk would NOT be reported in question W3.2d as an example of a water risk that could cause a substantive change to business, operations, revenue or expenditure as it did not exceed the threshold for substantive change to our business at the corporate level.

Sempra Energy’s 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission identifies the risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.  The 10-K identifies a few risk factors that are or could be a result of water-related issues, particularly drought.   However, for transparency purposes, in this response we have also included additional water-related risks that we have identified.  These risks do not meet the threshold of materiality relevant to our 10-K filing, but we believe are useful in providing to context to the significance of water in our operations and supply chain and therefore merit inclusion in this discussion.

However, for transparency purposes, in this response we have also included additional water-related risks that we have identified.  These risks do not meet the threshold of materiality relevant to our 10-K filing, but we believe are useful in providing to context to the significance of water in our operations and supply chain and therefore merit inclusion in this discussion.
Using the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool, we determined which major manufacturing and distribution facilities were located in water-stressed regions (having a "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk as determined by the tool) .  Substantive change will depend on how much product is produced or distributed from that facility as a percentage of total operations.

Sprint believes there are some risks associated with water, but does not believe these risks are material (per SEC reporting guidelines).In Sprint's direct operations, water is used in evaporative chiller systems to cool data centers, and large network and commercial office locations. Sprint defines substantive change from water risk as a forced replacement of operational equipment with alternative technology. “Substantive change” is based on the Base Water Stress level (2010) obtained by inputting data about Sprint's sites into WBCSD's Global Water Tool used to identify water stressed in river basins associated with our US-based operations. We combined our facility water-usage information with the information from WBCSD and found that 17 of Sprint’s top 50 water usage sites (70% of its consumption in 2015) are in extremely high water-stressed areas.Through Sprint's Trucost analyses in recent years, we also have been able to assess the scope of water consumed in its supply chain. Sprint's supply chain accounts for more than 99% of the company's overall water footprint. From here, Sprint plans on engaging its top water-consuming suppliers to begin understanding what substantive risks to Sprint's business, operations, revenues or expenditure their water usage poses.

We review our business annually during development of our operating plan and review progress against this quarterly.
In terms of water risk, Starwood defines a substantive change to be anything more than 5%. One particular metric which has been used to measure substantive changes resulting from water risk is "total guest rooms" (this applies to direct operations only and disregards any supply chain elements). Therefore, when using this metric, more than 5% of all Starwood guest rooms, globally, must be affected by one particular water basin to be considered substantive.

For direct operations we define the potential for substantive change in our business, operations, revenue, or expenditure from water risks as our facilities that score 16 or over on our internal Total Water Risk Index metric within our enterprise water risk assessment process (Water Plan).SBD's global Water Plan has foundation in our 2012 strategic communication, a 2013 launch of our global water scarcity strategy, and 2014-16 updates of such.  This in-process management method includes mapping SBD global locations against the United Nations Environment Program's vital water graphic layers for a multi-faceted risk evaluation to prioritize top water risk sites; then instituting water conservation efforts, governmental collaboration projects, and options for alternative water strategies at high risk sites.  We also use this management method to assess level of water risk potential during acquisition transaction considerations and due diligence.

Suncor uses an enterprise wide risk management system (ERM) to assess and define risk.  Like most ERM systems it uses a matrix that determines the consequence of a risk and the likelihood.  There are six (6) consequence and likelihood categories.  The ERM assign risks a ranking from I to IV for economic, environmental and social. Social is further broken down into Health & Safety, Reputation and Regulatory with guidance.  Suncor defines substantive risks that are risked rank at II or I; To define substantive change for the purpose of this assessment; an economic value of $10M was used this includes direct financial costs and lost opportunity value (LOV).

Currently, we monitor the availability of water in the areas where we operate, but have no concerns that would require substantive changes in our operations (such as any changes to our manufacturing output.)
Substantive change for our business as it relates to water availability would be lack of water necessary to conduct our manufacturing operations in a manner that complies with all applicable food safety regulatory requirements and standards.  Lack of water could be from on-site sources or from water supply sources, and could include significant curtailment of typical water supply needed to run the operation.  Another aspect of risk would be the ability to obtain ingredients that rely on adequate water supply for crop harvesting to meet production based on customer demands. Substantive change from an expenditure standpoint would be requirements to implement costly water reduction or conservation measures or equipment which would not result in a return on investment that meets our hurdle rate or an expenditure to obtain water or ingredients from alternative sources.

Union Pacific integrates water risks/opportunities into a multi-disciplinary Company-wide risk management process. Union Pacific utilizes an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process to incorporate input from Strategic Planning, Operations, Law, and the Environmental Management Group, among others, to identify potential water related risks and opportunities. Each element plays a role in the management of risks and opportunities and evaluation of materiality and priorities. In each case, the criteria for materiality and priorities are dictated first and foremost by an analysis of impacts to safety. Evaluation of impacts to ethics, customer service, and the environment also dictate materiality and priorities. These criteria and priorities are not mutually exclusive and overlap. Union Pacific assesses these impacts in terms of likelihood and magnitude of the impact, determines a response strategy, and monitors progress.

UTC defines a substantive change to our businesses to be any instance where a UTC site in China or Mexico  fails to manufacture or deliver products due to disruptions in manufacturing facility water supply. Both China and Mexico are important areas of strategic growth and substantial investment by UTC. Our sites there typically require material amounts of water for their operations and are located in areas of water scarcity, as identified by the WBCSD Water Risk Tool. These three factors - strategic growth potential for UTC, site water use and water scarcity- combine to present the potential for substantive change to our business and a greater water management challenge than at other UTC locations around the globe. Water risk presents a greater concern to UTC in China and Mexico because of its potential to impact regional economic and community robustness, which in turn increases the risk to our own strategic investments and business operations.UTC has numerous other facilities facing similar local water supply risks as those in China and Mexico, and the sole difference in our risk management assessment is the potential impact of water on our ability to attain strategic growth objectives in both of those areas.

Changes in precipitation patterns result in drought or flood conditions that will impact landfill function, not only in terms of additional costs to maintain operations but also will impact potential revenues from the collection and use of landfill gas for energy. Virtually any of WM’s landfills in the U.S. and Canada are vulnerable to intermittent drought conditions, flood conditions or both.Both flooding and drought impact the behaviors of materials decaying in a controlled MSW landfill environment. Flooding can impede the collection of landfill gas by filling collection wells with water; drought can reduce the rate of decay of organic material because water is essential to the decay process. Both extreme conditions result in additional labor being required to manage the landfill gas collection system, with additional liquids collection required to respond to excess moisture and with adjustments to gas collection system vacuum required to respond to the decrease in gas generation resulting from too little moisture. Also, additional labor and costs are incurred in compliance with regulatory obligations. Also, although WM is not a high volume water user, temporary disruptions in water supply could affect our operations.

WhiteWave employs a multi-disciplinary approach to risk management, with a Board of Directors (BOD) that reviews opportunities or risks identified by our Executive Leadership Team as part of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program (financial, regulatory, compliance, etc.) that would materially impact our objectives. ERM and the Risk Management Oversight Committee (RMOC) in N. America provide periodic updates to executive leadership discussing supply chain issues if they occur/when needed. The Risk Refresh is an annual process where the risk portfolio and risk profiles are reviewed, discussed and tiered based on prioritization methodology. Risks are considered as far into the future as reasonably possible. Sustainability updates are presented to the BOD after the annual environmental inventory is performed and as needed. Lastly, a cross-functional Issues Working Group (IWG) meets monthly to review emerging and ongoing issues affecting our brands, business & industry.For purposes of this survey, we used a screening criteria to identify sites meeting the CDP guidance for "substantive" as follows: 1) sites indicated as "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk per WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter, and 2) which are either considered strategic sites or those which account for >5% of global production volume.
With the drought in CA, we are engaging in water conservation practices and fixture retrofits.  We already executed much of this in southern California years ago.  A substantive change would mean we are moving toward a cap in supply and reduced availability.Other risks with the energy/water nexus may result in a much higher cost of operation due to both energy and water utilities' cost increases.

Severe weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms occur. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages, whether caused by climate change or otherwise, could adversely affect our operations, principally our fossil fuel-fired units. A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions could adversely impact our ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy. We may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.

Substantive change to our business as it relates to water risk is based upon our assessment of water risks at our global data centers and offices, inclusive of our direct operations only (not including our supply chain). Substantive change would be one that increased operational expenditure on water in excess of 1% of total annual company spend. Since total expenditure on water and wastewater combined is far less than this, we do not anticipate substantive change to occur. From an operational perspective, substantive change for facilities would include a requirement to significantly alter, close, and/or relocate the operations of a particular facility or group of facilities. Based on the results of our water risk assessment, there are no facilities that are sited in regions with identified water risk or stress that can generate a substantive change to occur. 																				
Risks, including water risks, are prioritized based on a number of factors that impact our organization and could create substantive change, including but not limited to regulatory, operational and reputational. More specifically, we look at the likelihood, size, and scope of the factors and the number of business units/divisions impacted. In addition, we consider the length of the factors’ impact and assess whether the impact is a one-time occurrence or recurring in nature. We then make a determination whether or not it is more effective in both the short and long-term to modify, adjust or alter our business strategy given the risks. Water risk is incorporated into the Company's broader risk management process. Water issues and initiatives are driven in partnership between the Sustainability, Public Affairs, Legal, and Financial teams, and other key functions as relevant. These teams work together to identify substantive risks to our business and company-owned operations that could potentially occur and work with our divisions and business units to mitigate the risks. Our most basic quantitative metric that indicates whether a store is exposed to water risks that could generate substantive change in our operations – i.e. impact a store’s ability to operate and generate revenue – is currently a Composite Risk Score of 3.75 or higher in our WRI Aqueduct assessment.
We define substantive change to our operations from water risks as:- sanctions corresponding to an interruption of production or cessation of activity for a short-term but finite duration; and/or,- significant, longer-term or offsite environmental impact requiring significant mitigation or additional long-term controls.Financially, we define a substantive change to an operation by using a cost threshold.

We use the WBCSD Global Water tool to assess potential substantive changes in our business and operations due to water stress.  HP Co. defines substantive change from water risk in our operations as facilities that are downgraded to either scarce or extremely scarce renewable water supply per person as defined by the WBSCD Global Water tool.  Our measurement is based on the total renewable water resource per person at a site as defined by the Water Tool.  Our threshold is when a facility moves from sufficient water supply to stressed.  This applies to all of our operations globally.  WE also apply similar methodology to our supply chain.  Based on 2015 facility data, we identified 44 sites that we considered to have scarce or extremely scarce renewable water supply per person.  Many of these sites have been considered water scarce for years and have become our best practice sites for water conservation.  We have continued to implement new measures under our 2020 goal to reduce freshwater consumption per employee 20% compared to 2010.

Cenovus’s operations, financial condition and in some cases our reputation, may be impacted by principal and strategic risks. Cenovus defines principal risks as those risks that when measured in terms of likelihood and impact, may adversely affect the achievement of our strategic or major business objectives. Strategic risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability to adequately plan or implement an appropriate business strategy, or to adapt to changes in the external business, political or regulatory environment. Risks are categorized into: •Financial risks, such as commodity price risk and liquidity risk; •Operational risks, such as risks related to safety, the environment, transportation restrictions, project execution and reserves replacement; and •Environment & Regulatory risks, such as those related to the regulatory approval process and changes to or introduction of environmental regulations including water conservation policy. We analyze risks using a standardized risk assessment tool primarily the Cenovus Risk Matrix. Using the Risk Matrix, each risk is classified on a continuum ranging from "Low" to "Extreme" based on the potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. Impact ratings range from "Minor" to "Catastrophic" and the likelihood ratings range from "Expected" to "Improbable". Risks are first evaluated on an inherent basis, without considering the presence of controls or mitigating measures. Risks are then re-evaluated based on their residual risk ranking, reflecting the risk that remains after implemented mitigation and control measures are considered. Risks classified as "High" or "Extreme" on Cenovus's Risk Matrix are included herein as "substantive".Our water risks are reviewed regularly and assessed based on estimated impact and likelihood. The water risks that have been identified as significant risks involved future exposure (generally greater than 5 years in future) and rare likelihood risks. Risk impacts considered substantial involved: delay obtaining new licences resulting in impacts to our developments plans; high costs of retrofitting new technologies on existing assets to meet more stringent regulations; or reputational impacts or negative media attention. These risks were assessed as having a rare likelihood of occurrence.

Pinnacle defines substantive change in their business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk using multiple variables - however, the most relevant indicator that is considered is the size of the impact to our business.  Pinnacle understands that climate change can affect crop seasons, water supply, and weather patterns which can have a substantive impact on the way that we do business.  Risk size is determined by financial impact.  As an example, risks are gauged by the dollar impact on earnings, assigned a probability and ranked by the size of the risk. A large portion of key ingredients and materials that we use in our products are highly dependent on the availability of water.  Our supply chain faces the largest risks due to changes in water availability and quantity which in turn, could result in higher costs for Pinnacle as well.  Our Procurement Leadership Team utilizes a supply chain risk management program that is designed to allow the Company to identify and manage risks inherent in its external supply chain, which includes assessing substantive changes in our business due to water risks.  Substantive changes in our supply chains are defined by overall risk and materiality to our business.Our direct operations also rely on the availability of water and our production operations could be impacted by change in weather patterns.  Because of the diversity of agricultural inputs in Pinnacle’s product portfolio, each single item does not create a significant risk and there exists generally supply alternatives. Additionally, the vast amount of Pinnacle’s operations and supply chain are located in North America with limited exposure to broad risks.
Water is a major ingredient in the majority of our products.  Water is also used for washouts (clean and sanitize equipment and the plant).  Recycled water is also used for cooling products.  All of these would affect expenditures if clean water was not readily available.

SunPower evaluates strategic and operational risks related to water resources across our business. Strategic risks are defined as risks to our company’s high-level goals or mission, which can have negative impacts to reputation or loss of trust. Operational risks are defined as risks that threaten effective and efficient use of SunPower’s resources including disruption to product supply, inefficient use of resources, and physical property damage. Once we have identified the relevant risks, we evaluate the potential financial impact of these risks to our direct operations and supply chain using quantitative thresholds based on the probability of a negative event and the impact of its consequences as well as qualitative factors such as management judgement. SunPower has defined “substantive change” as being a negative environmental or financial impact from water risk using these same risk thresholds and criteria. To put these risks into context for water resources, having just one major manufacturing facility down for a single day can equate to financial losses of more than $1 million USD per day, which would lead to a substantive change in our operations. An example of a risk: SunPower may experience an extreme storm event that damages infrastructure around the facility despite rigorous building standards and historical building post-storm preservation. This could lead to production and shipment delays, increases in operating costs, lost product sales, or the delay of new product launches, which could have an adverse effect on SunPower’s financial condition. Using the WRI aqueduct tool, SunPower evaluates locations with the potential for extreme weather events and water scarcity. Applying this approach, we have determined that any impact to Fabs 2 and 3 could lead to substantive changes since these represent over 95 percent of our overall water withdrawals, and represent 100 percent of our manufacturing locations. Fab 4 will be ramping in 2016; in addition to providing further redundancy, due to its new construction it could potentially survive an extreme storm event and continue operation.Our process for assessing substantive change is reviewed and updated on an annual basis with the help of a dedicated risk manager.

Although we do not use water within our manufacturing processes, we consider our company and supply chain subject to risks related to water, but do not consider the risks to be significant.  Like all companies, extreme weather events and resource shortages have the potential to interrupt our business and supply chain operations.  However, Motorola Solutions' operations generally are not located in low-lying areas subject to severe impacts from flooding.  Any disruption to our distribution channels could have a detrimental impact on our supply chain and product distribution.  Losses and interruption could be caused by water shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters, for which we predominantly are self-insured.

Definition of substantive change:To us, substantive refers to a significant disruption in supply to a customer, significant changes in cost structures or a significant loss of property, plant and equipment.One substantive change is associated with potential disruption in our operations (direct disruption), or in the transportation means (indirect disruption, roads blocked by flood for example). We develop contingency plans (often the request of customers) to address these issues. This kind of changes add complexity and costs to our operations (increased warehousing/stocks, investments to develop process capabilities across the company)Another substantive change is that adapting to more and more stringent regulation requires additional expenditure (investment in equipment, organization and control).Measured metrics or indicators: Loss of orders from a customer (in tons and revenue), increased production costs (replacement of damaged equipment, in capex plan, in $), loss of production capacity (in hours /days of shutdown, eventually translated into loss of sales and revenue)Threshold or amount of change indicating substantive change: Above 5Mi$ loss of revenue.Application of definition:To direct operations only, not to the supply chain.Another separate risk assessment is applied to the supply chain (described in question 3.2d)Frequency of revision of the threshold: The ERM (Enterprise Risk Management) committee meets twice a year to review and potentially revise the risk matrix and criteria.Process for the review:The review includes scaling the strategic, reputational, operational, financial and regulatory impacts, in addition of likelihood and velocity.
Only a catastrophic failure of the water table would cause a risk to the business.

A possible risk would be increase to water costs and disposal rates due to high demand, especially at our facilities having higher water consumption for e-coat purposes.  Although it is difficult to say what is substantive at this time, any increases would impact on our overall business revenues and have to be absorbed.  We do not see changes in water rates changing any current operations.Business growth in the area of 2 of our Mexico facilities may further increase demand on water resources and water quality in these areas.

Substantive change in business is defined as designing fewer new products, outsourcing process out of state...etc.
Lack of water may impact manufacturing operations where water is used. The manufacturing operations may have to obtain water externally or other sources which could be expensive, may be difficult to obtain and increase the cost of operations.In the U.S. the river basins or rivers adjacent to the locations where the factories are : Susquehanna River, Nashua River, Ohio River.In germany the locations are supported by local rivers: Neckar river, Teltow canal.

Water risks are incorporated into each location's ISO 14001 environmental aspects analysis to determine significant impacts and proirities.
Xylem does not have a corporate-wide definition for “substantive change” but since water is integrated into every component of our business, water risks are a key element of our risk management and business continuity planning. Our risks are managed by a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program that has a corporate framework consisting of five key components: (1) Risk Appetite and Strategy, (2) Governance and Organization, (3) Policies and Procedures, (4) Risk Management Process, and (5) Monitoring and Reporting. This framework directly supports the ERM Program’s objective of establishing “practical and sustainable policies, procedures and processes that help the Company manage and monitor risk effectively.” As such, the Program and its framework provide the means by which Xylem monitors and prioritizes its risks and governs its risk profile.Every Xylem site is also responsible for developing and implementing a site-specific Business Continuity Plan, including as elements Crisis Management Plans and IT Disaster Recovery Plans. Xylem's set of Business Continuity policies sets forth the specific requirements for business continuity responsibility, planning, risk assessment and business impact analysis, reporting and program maintenance. This policy requires Xylem sites to have in place a comprehensive set of business strategies and actions designed to protect safety, minimize the impact of a business interruption and facilitate return to normal operational levels. This process requires sites to evaluate change on a frequent basis and plan for situations that could have a substantive change to our business before they actually do. An analysis of water-related risks will be included in the local Business Continuity Plans for all Xylem facilities. . This proactive procedure helps Xylem to mitigate the risks posed by water including increased water scarcity, regulatory uncertainty and declining water quality. In daily operations, Kevin Jaffe, VP, Legal and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, oversees a corporate staff responsible for managing Xylem’s water- and climate change-related risks as they relate to Xylem's assets and operations. In addition, in each Growth Center there are EHS&S staff who report to line management and have dotted line reporting to Mr. Jaffe’s organization, ensuring linked effective risk management.

Delta Beverages does not believe that our organization is exposed to water risks because we believe that the municipal water supply is capable of providing the required quantity and quality of water for Delta's operations for the foreseeable future. The municipal water supply that feeds Delta Beverages is drawn from Lake Ontario which is one of the largest lakes in North America and the 14th largest lake in the world. That being said, Delta Beverages recognizes the importance of a reliable water supply to its continued business operations. Any disruption to the quantity of water supplied to Delta Beverages would force the organization to temporarily shut down its operations until sufficient water supply resumed. Any operational shut down due to lack of water supply would be considered to be a substantive change to our business operations. Issues with the quality of the water supplied could also temporarily shut down Delta's operations. If these water quality issues continued to persist, it may be necessary for Delta Beverages to make investments in more water treatment equipment. Such expenditure would also be considered a substantive change to our business operations.

Regeneron defines a substantive change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk to be anything that disrupts the business to meet specific levels across five Regeneron Business Impact Criteria. Regeneron considers this to be a low potential risk in the short-term, but understands that limited access to fresh water may affect our long term viability as the company continues to expand into regions with higher water-related risks. This definition only applies to our direct operations and does not include considerations to our suppliers’ water related risks.
Substantive change would typically involve impacts on an expansion of production at a specific site, or the development of expanded production at a new site. A significant change in supply/availability of raw materials could be considered  substantive.

SDP has its own internal procedure on how to ensure the compliance of the company on water quality discharge in the Subic Techno Park sewer line going to Boton River. The management has also plan to re-use the treated water from the Sewage Treatment Plant in the urinals and toilets of Building 1 and Building 2. This project aims to reduce water consumption as well as cost reduction. In addition, SDP will zero discharge since treated water will re-use in the company.

We acknowledge that changes in water availability will have an impact on our company and we believe it deserves serious attention. However, based on our understanding of the CDP definition of “significance,” (independent of any analysis used for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting purposes), we have concluded that change cited in this question cannot be categorized as having the potential to generate substantive change in our direct operations.

Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials due to water risk may have an adverse impact on profitability.  Flowers Foods identifies manufacturing sites that could potentially contribute to substantial change due to water risks as those that meet the following criteria:1)	Sites with a) ”High” or “Extremely High” Baseline water stress and b) Projected Annual Renewable Water Supply in 2025 of less than 500 m3 or 500-1000 m3 per person (using the WBCSD Global Water Tool’s WRI Aqueduct Data)2)	Account for more than 2% of total production volume
Substantive change in both our business operations and supply chain would include a reduced level of operations at any single facility such that the individual facility would not be capable of supplying the entire quantity of production needed to meet global commercial demand for that product. Potential negative impacts could be the experience of a reduction in revenues and inability to service therapeutic/medical market demands for the product affected. This substantive change could also negatively impact AbbVie's Research and Development operations and supply chain through a reduction in that organization's ability to promote discovery, development and clinical investigations in new therapeutic areas.

Axalta recognizes that as participants in the global economy we must be stewards of the environment in which we operate. Making coatings involves the use of energy, raw materials and water and results in emissions and wastes of various kinds. In addition, we recognize that industrial processes can pose safety risks to employees and others when not carefully managed. We have programs in place designed to safeguard the health andsafety of our people, products and manufacturing processes, as well as the communities where we live. Our commitment to sustainability provides a guidepost for our behavior and a lens to measure our performance.Axalta considers a substantive change in operations as any event that can cause a negative impact to the health, safety, environment, reputation, financial, human rights and social issues. The company takes into account the water usage as well as the economic relevance/impact of the operations.

Birla Carbon’s production process has generally not changed over a number of years.  Where technological innovations are available we have made process changes to ensure maximum water efficiency utilization.  Through water retention and recycling programs and other conservation measures we do not anticipate substantive changes in our water risks unless there is some significant unforeseen circumstance in a specific geographic location where water resource might become unavailable or substantially increased in cost.  Poor water quality and potential flooding is possible in some of our locations and we have integrated those risks into our Enterprise Risk Management approach.

Substantive change is defined as any event could impact our direct operations or supply chain to a degree that it would significantly interrupt product flow to our customers in any of the global markets that we serve. While water is a key resource for our operations and supply chain, geographic diversification helps to mitigate this risk. Abbott’s diversified business model has wide geographical distribution designed to significantly mitigate the impact of any single event. Abbott constantly shapes its portfolio to ensure that we are in the right markets and success is not over reliant on a single therapy, technology or country. Abbott currently has over numerous manufacturing sites located throughout the World and over 68,000 suppliers. Abbott has an established Enterprise Risk Management Process that supports the Board in risk oversight and Abbott leadership in risk management. The process is designed to identify potential events that could impact the company and manage risk within our risk tolerances. Risks related to weather or other natural events are monitored and responded to daily, while regulatory and customer issues are managed at a frequency consistent with the issue. Key action plans to address critical risks and opportunities are typically managed as goals and progress is monitored throughout the year with formal performance reviews. Any issue with immediate business impact is quickly elevated to senior management levels while long-term business risk and opportunity issues are managed and elevated to the appropriate level of management as part of structured annual planning processes.For our direct operations we use the WRI Aqueduct and WBCSD Global Water Tools in concert to identify the risk level for sites on an annual basis as follows: Sites that are "High" or "Extremely High" baseline water stress per WRI Aqueduct and “Extreme Scarcity” or “Scarcity” for renewable water supply per the WBCSD Global Water Tool are classified as water stressed.  Critical suppliers are mapped against water stress using the WRI Aqueduct Tool to identify critical suppliers operating in high and extremely high baseline water-stressed regions. Mapping our suppliers against water stress allows us to focus on suppliers with the greatest risk of water supply interruptions now and in the future, which could adversely affect our supply chain and raw material costs.

At 3M, we continually evaluate our approach to opportunity and risk. We believe the whole concept of risk appetite and tolerance is an essential component of strategic planning.  This includes a broad risk oversight by the Board and its committees, with committee-level risk analyses reported to the full Board and executive-level internal auditor and Chief Compliance Officer appointed by, and reporting directly to, the Audit Committee.Enterprise Risk designation is reserved for a limited number of factors identified as having the potential to negatively, significantly and directly impact our enterprise value due to loss of revenues, earnings, balance sheet position or company reputation for an extended period of time.  Discussion of these factors, as it relates to the Company, are incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in 3M's Annual Report: http://s2.q4cdn.com/974527301/files/doc_downloads/2017/Annual/2016_3M_Annual_Report.pdf.

AMD defines substantive change to their business by using a screening process as follows: 1) identify sites indicated "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk using the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool 2) cross check whether high risk sites are considered strategic to AMD business and highly dependent on water availability 3) determines whether high risk sites have appropriate contingency plans for sourcing water if local resources were not available. If high risk and strategic sites do not have adequate contingency plans, then the risks posed from these sites can contribute to a substantive change in our business. AMD is currently not aware of high water risk sites that generate a substantive change in our business operations, revenue, or expenditures. But risks could arise in the future, namely due to the importance of water use in our supply chain manufacturing operations.

Our risk-management process is structured around the Integrated Framework for Enterprise Risk Management from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization’s ISO 31000 (risk management). We use the process to identify and evaluate a broad spectrum of risks. It is structured using our key business drivers and organizational goals to ensure that all aspects of the business have been covered. Business drivers include our reputation, brand, earnings and operating margins. Organizational goals include excellence in stewardship of the environment, health and safety, a consistently fair representation of financial information, organic growth and more. The identified risks are grouped into risk areas and presented to management to determine how they should be prioritized. Our process is multi-dimensional and focuses on several aspects, including likelihood of occurrence, level of impact and mitigating risk factors. Each is considered in assessing and prioritizing risk, with more emphasis placed on likelihood and impact. The collaborative process by which risks are identified, evaluated and managed ensures that senior management remains aware and vigilant in managing key risks that could impact the company. The Alcoa Board of Directors maintains oversight of our risk management, and our management reports on specific risks on a periodic basis. A discussion of our significant risks can be found in our 2016 Annual Report and Form 10-K (attached) for the year ended December 31, 2016, starting on page 28. Shortages of water are mentioned on page 39 under the Climate change risk factor.Scarcity of water has been added to the list of key risks in our Enterprise Risk Management process. The ERM supports several objectives inside the risk management area. We use this process to foster a risk management philosophy to the leadership of the company. We also use it to identify, prioritize, monitor and mitigate the key risks that Alcoa faces into its day-to-day activities. ERM is used to ensure the communication among Alcoa business units, resource units, executive team and board of directors in matters related to risk.

Potable water is a necessary resource to our manufacturing process. Should water become extremelyscarce in regions where we manufacture our products, it could potentially have an impact on our manufacturing operations. This potential risk has been identified at a functional level within Environment, Health, Safety, and Sustainability and is considered a low potential risk.
A substantive change is a significant modification or expansion in the scope or nature of Anadarko’s direct operations (not suppliers) at a field level, as measured by the level of activity or production of an asset from sourcing, management or disposal of water. Anadarko has a deep portfolio of opportunities in the U.S. onshore, most of which would be considered unconventional resource plays. As such, these assets require access to water for drilling and completions operations. Without an adequate supply of water, Anadarko and/or its suppliers would need to develop alternatives, allocate capital to other assets in its portfolio, and/or consider reducing the level of activity in a given play. The threshold amount of change necessary will differ among operational plays based upon the economics involved with the required change. These considerations are a significant part of our investment, engagement and water-management strategies to ensure adequate supplies of and appropriate disposal of water at all of our U.S. onshore growth opportunities. Additionally, activity levels are evaluated continuously as part of our capital allocation process for each field. During this process, potential changes in operations and costs, including water availability, management and disposal, are considered.
We rate our risk based on a measure of probability versus severity. A substantial ("substantive change") risk would be one that: - has a high level of probability, meaning most key factors contributing to the risk are present.  There may be deficiencies in controls or procedures currently in place.  Historically, the event has occurred with some frequency within Aptar or the industry.  The event is considered likely to occur once every 1-5 years.- has a high level of severity, meaning the potential impact on cash flow and earnings is material and will directly impact Aptar’s ability to meet strategic business objectives.  Quantified as impacts of $10 million or more.We rank probability and severity from 0 (low) - 10 (high). Per this heat map, a "substantive change" would be an item that:-has severity 3.5 - 6.5 and probability of 6.5 or greater;-has probability of 3.5 - 6.5 and severity of 6.5 or greater;-or has a severity and a probability of greater than 6.5

At Applied, we define substantive change as anything that could disrupt our business. Through our business continuity, risk management, and supply chain teams, we are continually re-evaluating and prioritizing potential risks. For new projects, we have an ongoing project review process and look for an ROI of 18 months for any capital expenditures. In the past, this has included some water efficiency projects or integrating water improvements into planned upgrades. For example, we undertook the Austin Industrial Waste Neutralization (IWN) Program, launched in September, 2015, has had a substantial impact on water usage—a savings of approximately 16,000 gallons of water per day, or 6.3 million gallons per year. Prior to the IWN program, the Austin wet tool manufacturing operations tested waste distilled water and used reverse osmosis to neutralize the water and then discharged it to the City of Austin publically-owned treatment works (POTW). The IWN reclamation program reuses treated industrial wastewater in the cooling towers at the Austin manufacturing facility as make-up water. Each gallon of reclaimed IWN waste water added to the cooling towers for make-up directly replaces potable water that would otherwise have been used. Excess volumes of reclaimed waste water continue to flow through the lift station to the City of Austin POTW.During the cooler months, the recycled wastewater provides over 90 percent of the total cooling tower make-up water and augments the original make-up water source during hotter months. The positive impact of this project was recognized by the City of Austin for Excellence in Water Conservation in 2015. Probably, the place where we have some of the most substantive risks is to the evolution of our products. We work closely with our clients to understand how water is influencing their purchasing decisions. In addition, we follow the best practices in tool development and specifications for water outlined in the SEMI industry requirements.

We use the WBCSD Water Tool to inform the process of identifying water stress areas in our U.S.-based operations. We combine our facility water-usage information with the information from WBCSD to target operations with high water use in areas of high stress Although we are not experiencing current direct water risks from our supply chain, water is critical within our suppliers’ operations, and any impact they experience due to water risk, may affect our future business operations. For this reason we will continue assessing our suppliers’ water risks using the annual survey mentioned in W2.2.

Material ESG risks and opportunities are those that have an impact on our stakeholders’ decisions to work with us, whether as a client, investor, vendor or community partner. We collect feedback from internal and external sources, including via our National Community Advisory Council, to determine our most important issues. We completed an ESG materiality assessment in 2016, working with BSR who conducted interviews with executives and surveyed external stakeholders to determine key issues of interest. The outcomes of these interviews were reviewed, prioritized and agreed upon by our Global ESG Committee. ESG Investing and Low-Carbon Financing are among the 5 issues identified as most relevant to our ongoing growth and success.Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework (ESRPF) identifies the environmental and social topics we recognize to be of heightened importance to our company andour stakeholders, and our approach to them. Recognizing that certain sectors may be more exposed to climate change risks than others, we engage in enhanced due diligence for business activities in these sectors to evaluate the associated risks, including physical, regulatory and reputational risks. Sectors of heightened sensitivity include arctic drilling, coal, palm oil and forestry. The ESRPF sets out our positions on these matters, including certain minimum client requirements found within our policies. For example, we require clients whose business is focused on ownership and management of palm oil plantations and operations to have their operations certified to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil standard or equivalent or to have in place an outlined action plan and schedule for certification. For CDP reporting, we consider risks and opportunities with potential financial implications of over $10 million per year to be substantive.At the facility level, our Proximity Risk Program prioritizes risk based on scores derived through the assessment of the severity and likelihood of occurrence for each risk category.

For the purposes of previous CDP reports, any long-term or medium-term deviation with a magnitude of greater than $200 M cash flow impact or 10% of the life of mine (LOM) key parameters, such as production rate, waste management, and increase in capital/operational cost etc., were considered substantive change applies to direct operations only.  In the reporting year of 2016, our risk assessment process has become more robust and is now considering more components beyond dollar factors and has now advanced to include the following.  Mining operations generally requires years of exploration, engineering design, environmental impact study, permit application and construction to be developed. Once constructed, every operation follows a LOM plan that schedules the annual production rate, waste management and environmental remediation etc. from operation to closure and post closure. We consider a wide range of risk factors in our corporate level risk monitoring and assessment, aligning strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge in order to evaluate and manage uncertainties the company faces.Risks are understood and evaluated using the Barrick qualitative risk analysis process, including cash flow impact, life-of-mine key parameters, such as production rate, waste management, and increase in capital/operational cost etc. License to operate components are also included in the assessment. Environmental risks could trigger water related consequences. Barrick´s Water Conservation Standard requires each operation and site to perform a water risk assessment on an annual basis. As part of this exercise, in 2015, the risk thresholds were reviewed in light of developments in the business to ensure they are meaningful, and amended as appropriate.  Barrick is also developing a comprehensive Water Management Framework to support assessment and mitigation of water related risks, including consideration of:  -	Water Location-	Water Scarcity-	Environmental Impacts to water-	Regulatory compliance on water-	Water Quality-	Water Quantity-	Water Management on Closure-	Community perception

A substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risks is defined as an unplanned disruption of the potable water supply and/or degradation of water quality of 1 hour or longer, which may be substantial enough to warrant shutting down portions of our manufacturing processes. As our manufacturing process is highly regimented, delays at any stage due to a water shortage has the potential to require the entire batch to be discarded for quality and safety concerns. Additionally, some of our suppliers are under similar constraints and substantial shutdowns for them could impact our material supplies, thus restricting our operations.

We follow an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process that encompasses our entire company to identify, assess, prioritize and address major risks on an ongoing basis.  ERM addresses the full spectrum of risks: market/environmental, compliance, legal, strategic, financial/operational and reputational.  When a significant risk is identified, the process includes the development, implementation and monitoring of risk mitigation strategies and reporting. Within ERM, we define Business Continuity Management as a holistic management process that identifies lower-probability significant events, including those resulting from climate change-related events such as the increased frequency or severity of weather conditions, including hurricanes, typhoons or tornados.The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors participates in regular reviews of our ERM process to assess and manage enterprise risks, including those related to market/environmental, strategic, financial, operational, legal, compliance and reputational risks. As appropriate, these risks would include water risks.  In addition, each of the other standing Board Committees regularly meet to discuss the short-term and long-term objectives and provide oversight for risks related to the applicable committee’s areas of responsibility.  As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight as part of its fiduciary duty of care to effectively monitor business operations. Our Board administers its risk oversight function as a whole and through its Committees.  The asset or operational responsibility for these areas is delegated to the senior executive level.

Brown-Forman evaluates many variables in determining substantive change of our business and operations. One such variable is the overall availability of water for use in our direct operations. Globally, our company faces some direct risk associated with water scarcity because of the location of our operations and the requirements for water in our production processes and finished products. This risk stems from constraints on the available quantity, quality, and cost of water supplies across our enterprise but especially from a minority of our operations located in certain sensitive areas.Furthermore, a number of our key ingredients are agricultural based and are also dependent upon the availability of water. Any change in water dynamics, including water stress or even flooding, could cause supply disruptions or alterations in our supplier arrangements. This would result in cost increases for Brown-Forman. Also within our supply chain, we utilize co-packers for final completion of products. These facilities, while outside our operational control, rely upon abundant amounts of high quality water to carry out their services. Any disruption to their operations could impact the production and delivery of products.Weather, the effects of climate change, diseases, and other agricultural uncertainties that affect the mortality, health, yield, quality, or price of the various raw materials used in our products also present risks for our business, including in some cases potential impairment in the recorded value of our inventory. Changes in weather patterns or intensity can substantively disrupt our supply chain as well, which may affect production operations, insurance costs and coverage, as well as the timely delivery of our products to customers.Water is one of the major components of our products, so the quality and quantity of available water is important to our ability to operate our business. If droughts become more common or severe, or if our water supply were interrupted for other reasons, high-quality water could become scarce in some key production regions for our products, including Tennessee, Kentucky, California, Canada, and Mexico.

While Bunge has not defined a numerical threshold for what constitutes a substantive risk related to water, material impacts to the company’s financial results may stem from three types of risk:Our sugar production depends on the volume and sucrose content of the sugarcane that we cultivate or that is supplied to us by third-party growers. Both sugarcane crop yields and sucrose content depend significantly on weather conditions, such as rainfall and prevailing temperatures.  As such, unfavorable weather conditions have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our sugar operations.Adverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, reduce demand for our fertilizer products and negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us.Severe adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or flooding, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries and other loss and damage to us. Our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services. A disruption in transportation services, as a result of weather conditions or otherwise, may also significantly adversely impact our operations.

We realize that water risks could cause a substantive change in our business.  First, our operations could be affected if we had to shut down our manufacturing facilities due to a lack of water.  This would significantly impact our revenues.  Next, if water related risks impact our suppliers, we could either be impacted by not being able to obtain enough ingredients to make our products or have to pay a higher price for them.  At the end of the day, both of these things would have a negative impact on our revenues.

We define substantive change by risks to water that materially impact our business, operations, revenue or expenditure in a negative way for a significant period of time that would prevent us from carrying on normal operations and manufacturing activities to make and ship our products to customers. A substantive scenario could lead to reduced business in the mid-term, reduction in revenue, and increase expenditures to cope with realized risk time periods.

Clorox has enterprise risk management processes to identify, assess and prioritize business risks. Clorox uses a systematic process to evaluate risks. The process includes identifying risks, assessing exposures and quantifying the value at risk to the company. The evaluation considers level of potential impact, the overall vulnerability to an event based on the time and our capacity to react and adapt, and the likelihood of an occurrence.While severe regional weather events have the potential to disrupt our operations, or that of our customers and/or suppliers, we believe our dispersed supply chain affords us redundancy, which mitigates risk to our business from localized events. Additionally, Clorox engages in engineering loss-prevention strategies aimed at reducing the risk of natural and accidental hazards and each location has backup power supply for critical functions. The company’s manufacturing locations have comprehensive emergency response plans and most locations have business continuity plans. The company’s headquarters also has an emergency response plan with trained floor wardens, established evacuation procedures and business continuity plans for critical functions. We believe the location of our facilities limit threats from rising ocean levels.
Consumers Energy defines a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure for water risk as any change that would dramatically affect our operation reliability, costs or reputation.  The definition applies to direct operations. Specific levels of change or numeric metrics of change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure for water are not established.  Electricity markets are complex and based on many factors, including the relative cost of electricity within an established organization, often covering several states.  The organization is approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to coordinate, control and monitor the use of the electric transmission system by utilities, generators and marketers. For the operations and facilities covered in this response, that organization is the Mid-Continent Independent System Operator (MISO), Zone 7.

Colgate uses an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program to identify, assess, prioritize and manage physical risks. The ERM Committee is sponsored by the Chairman, President and CEO of the Company and includes representation from key internal business leaders.  Risks are collectively identified across the organization and are classified within the Strategic, Financial, Operational, Information Technology, Legal & Compliance and Emerging Risk Categories.  Each Risk Category is assigned an owner who is also a member of the ERM Committee and who is ultimately accountable for successfully managing the identified risk.  The Natural Disaster ERM - addresses the physical risks associated with water and climate change that could disrupt our commercial and supply chain operations.   Colgate also has a formal process to identify critical suppliers (e.g. high volume suppliers, suppliers of critical materials, non-substitutable formulas). Every year we update our segmentation strategies where we classify materials and suppliers according to the criticality of the material segment as well as the market complexity and buyer power using a matrix tool. Selected agricultural materials that are impacted by change in precipitation extremes and droughts are considered in this process. Risk management plans including changes in source of supply and potential alternative formulations are in place.For purposes of this survey, we used a screening criteria to identify sites meeting the CDP guidance for "substantive" as follows: 1) sites indicated as "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk per WRI Aqueduct, and 2) which are either considered strategic sites or those which account for >2% of global production volume.This threshold is evaluated annually, when the Aqueduct tool is used to evaluate water risk. The Global Sustainability and EHS group engages with local sites to evaluate the threshold based on both the Aqueduct tool and more short-term and local conditions and events.

Water-related risks are particularly relevant to the food industry, with a global supply chain intensely dependent on the availability of clean water to grow ingredients. Managing water risk — both at our own facilities and those embedded in our supply chain — is critical to Conagra Brands’ long-term business success. To determine whether these water-related risks have potential to generate a substantive change in our business operations, revenue or expenditures, we've applied US Securities Exchange Commission materiality principles, considering both quantitative and qualitative impacts.  The risk analysis factors in both the probability of the risk and estimated financial implications.  For this purpose, material risks generating substantive change to our direct operations and supply chain would be changes affecting more than 5% of our revenue or assets.

In defining substantive change to our business, operations, revenues or expenditures from water risk, Constellation considers both the magnitude of the potential loss, and the likelihood of the risk. For the purposes of this report, we define substantive change as the potential loss of 5% or more of our global production volume as well as the potential loss of 5% in each segment of our business (beer vs. wine & spirits). This percentage may vary slightly year to year. This metric includes only our direct Operations and not our supply chain.
We define substantive site-level water risks as any facility (direct operation) meeting all of the following criteria:(1) Site is identified as being High or Extremely High risk utilizing our ensemble risk tool methodology;(2) Site accounts for >5% of our global production by volume; and(3) Site is considered strategic to the growth strategy of the organization.Sites are evaluated against these criteria annually to determine if they meet this definition, indicating a substantive change

Cummins uses a multi-pronged approach to evaluate risks and opportunities and determining if they are substantive to our business. Cummins Business Continuity Planning function prioritizes and addresses key risks of which water related issues are one component. Cummins developed a cause and effect (C&E) matrix to prioritize sites combining multiple factors including: 1) site’s self-assessment of water risk from a survey on source water sustainability, quality, discharge, regulatory, and cost considerations addressing both current and future conditions, 2) site size and complexity, 3) the presence or absence of water supply assessments, 4) and watershed-specific water stress indicators.  For water stress indicators, Cummins worked with an external consultant to develop a composite picture of current and future water stress by combining data from WRI Aqueduct Tool, WBCSD Global Water Tool, and consultant expertise in the countries/regions where we operate. Portions of this data extend to a 2025 planning horizon.  Scoring and weighting factors were applied to each of the 4 components of the C&E matrix and an ‘at risk’ threshold was defined as any sites scoring 150 or above in total composite score. Based on this, Cummins conducted detailed watershed assessments at each of the 3 locations scoring above the 150 ‘at risk’ threshold, recently we added two more sites.  BFCEC due to its growth that raised the risk scoring and CBL due to specific water issues arising in the area. In addition to the watershed assessments over 24 site level audits have been conducted to further validate conditions at prioritized sites.  These audits and assessments identified specific areas for water management improvements including conservation, risk management, and community/watershed engagement opportunities.Facility data and conditions are reviewed annually and may alter the priority sites from year to year. In addition to the six sigma project, CMI has developed a risk scoring tool that utilizes real time risk and quality data available from Maplecroft.  This new tool can be used at any time and will assign a risk factor for each site that can be used when evaluating investment opportunities. It will also help in the evaluation of a supplier and new facility locations.

To generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenues, or expenditures, any particular event or change would have to impact either a wide range of product lines or a large swath of our stores. Because of the wide geographical diversity and the many diverse product lines that we sell, an impact on any one store or product line would not substantively impact the company as a whole.

As stated in our 2016 fiscal year 10-K, John Deere's business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment.  This may include water related items such as timing and quantity of rainfall, excessive rain, flooding and drought conditions. Due to the variability and uncertainty of weather conditions affecting our customers globally, for the purposes of this CDP response we are focused on our direct operations, and the water risk attributes of water scarcity and volume. Using the WRI Aqueduct Tool, we define substantive change from water risk in terms of water scarcity and volume for those manufacturing and distribution operations currently sited in regions defined as having a baseline water stress of extremely high stress, high stress, and medium to high stress considering a projected change over 20 years. We also determine if these sites are considered strategic meaning they account for >2% of global production volume. If both criteria are met, then these sites could pose a substantive change in our business, operations or revenue.

Our process for defining and identifying substantive changes is the same process used to establish Strategic Growth Plans (SGPs), annual objectives, and monthly/quarterly priorities. At the enterprise level, we also utilize a risk assessment process to identify and track significant business risks.We develop strategic plans and associated initiatives based on annual input from business unit leaders, market research and analysis, as well as external and functional expertise. At the enterprise level, a strategic framework provides direction for refining business unit strategies. In developing our strategic objectives, we endeavor to identify any opportunities or risks (financial, regulatory, capability, etc.) that would improve or impede our ability to achieve our objectives.Further, the capital budgeting process includes criteria for sustainability and water related risks and opportunities.

From an operational perspective, substantive change to our business from water risk would be defined according to disrupted operations or lost  production due to the unavailability of water. Devon has been effective in its proactive evaluation of risks and opportunities to ensure continuing operations.
The impact of environmental regulations is considered during Diebold Nixdorf's combined annual sustainability and risk assessment. Regulatory impacts to our business are considered from a cost of compliance, reputation impacts, loss of business, and the potential for financial penalties. Environmental impacts due to pollution and other environmental conditions is rated on a risk impact scale. Regional and Country officers, numbering more than 150, of the Global Sustainability and Social Responsibility team coordinate and review risks and opportunities related to climate change at the facility level. The results of the integrated annual Risk Assessment are reported to the Diebold Nixdorf Executive Leadership Team, and the Advisory Council.

As stated in our annual 10-K filing, weather, climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business.We may be faced with water availability risks. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. Climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate, and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.

The majority of our operations and supply chain takes place in Michigan, which has an abundant fresh water supply.  Although the risks to our company are low at this time, the risks are expected to increase in the future (e.g. as regulations continue to change and challenge our industry).  An example of a substantive change would be legislation or a physical change in supply that would reduce our ability to withdraw the amount of water needed to produce adequate amount of electricity for our customers.

DuPont defines substantive change in terms of the SEC definition for materiality. What constitutes “material” must be judged from the viewpoint of a reasonably prudent investor making a decision to buy, hold or sell stock. An item is considered material, if in the light of surrounding circumstances, the magnitude of the item is such that it is probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the item. DuPont does not believe it has any material water risks.  In item 1A of our annual 10-K, we do identify unpredictable seasonal and weather factors as a risk that could impact sales and earnings from the company’s Agriculture segment.  Weather factors such as droughts or changing precipitation patterns could impact the agriculture sector in several ways.  Please refer to Item 1A of our annual 10-K report for a discussion of risk factors.  It can be found here: www.investors.dupont.com.

We employ a multifaceted process to determine our company’s material issues in order to align materiality with our company and customers’ key business drivers. Ecolab’s annual enterprise “Assessment of Significant Business Risks” provides the foundation for assessing the materiality of issues to our business. The annual assessment is conducted using a survey tool designed to identify strategic, operational, financial and compliance-related risks to the company. Risks are documented along with the likelihood and impact of their occurrence. An audit-services vice president manages the process, and the results are presented to the executive committee and Ecolab board of directors. The most significant, and therefore substantive business risks are reported publicly through the company’s annual 10-K filing.Using the Assessment of Significant Business Risks as a foundation, we undertook a rigorous process to analyze risks and opportunities specific to sustainability in 2013 and revisit this work bi-annualy. We embarked on a strategic approach to better understand and measure against the issues that present material risks and opportunities to our company as they align with the interests of our stakeholders (primarily customers) but we also engage a diverse set of stakeholders to assess the materiality of sustainability-specific issues including employees, customers, investors and relevant external groups.Substantive change to our business as it relates to water risk is based upon an assessment of water risks at our direct manufacturing operations related to our production volume where it can effect greater than 10% of our direction operations and facilities by production. This definition does not yet apply to our supply chain. This assessment and its criteria are reviewed annually and incorporated into our annual business risk assessment and reporting processes.

We define a substantive change as any water-related impact that results in material reduction or stoppage in production and/or revenue at our sites, or a large change in expenditures relating to water sourcing, treatment and management.
In our business, bulk active ingredient manufacturing sites use the largest amounts of water followed by final dosage finishing sites. Packaging sites require very little water and present less risk to the organization. In our Global Supply Chain, we already take into account manufacturing issues that could shut down bulk active ingredient sites for 6 to 10 months, drug final dosage finishing manufacturing for 2 to 3 months and packaging for 1 to 2 months.  We use inventory management practices as a primary risk mitigation strategy. An extreme water stress event (i.e. a drought that provided a moratorium on water use for many months) would have to extend beyond these periods for there to be a potential economic impact on Lilly. Our Global Supply Chain area also works with our Treasury area and an external consultant to develop scenarios of "catastrophic" events (i.e. a manufacturing site being "destroyed"). We determined that a drought/water disruption scenario would have to extend for a long period of time (i.e,. several years) to cause a substantive change to our business. Given these conditions and our product mix, we made a determination that extended periods of drought should not significantly impact our business. Costs associated with these analyses are embedded in operating budgets and are not disclosed.

The Enbridge Liquid Pipelines business unit defines risk to water as having a substantive change to our business using a standardized risk matrix to evaluate risk consequence and likelihood.  Where Enbridge’s operations could impact water the risk consequence is considered to be Major to Critical; however the likelihood of events occurring at these locations is kept Low through multiple control and mitigation measures.  The risk consequence of an impact to water range defined as Major to Critical ranges in financial value from >$1M to ≤$1B, impacts an area ranging in size from 0.1 ha to 1 km2 and impacts a waterbody ranging from a wetland to a lake or fast moving creek or river.  Ecological restoration activities could range from 1 to 10 years in duration.   Project risks around water which could contribute to substantive changes to business are assessed through the use of a Risk Screening Tool.  Risk levels are classified as Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High with a set of detailed impact criteria associated to each level.  Risks associated with leaks and spills to water from a stakeholder materiality perspective are considered to have a Very High Impact and Very High Probability.  The Impact Criteria include costs in excess of $50M, a delay in milestone achievements (i.e. project completion) of greater than 6 months and a service disruption of greater than 1 month for our customers.A risk consequence of Major to Critical would be considered to be a substantive change to our business.
Substantive change is defined as impacting the economic viability of an operational area or facility, triggering a new evaluation of whether the facility is a net asset or liability.  For instance, if the cash flows no longer exceed the anticipated abandonment or the cumulative positives are less than the book value (up front capital), there may be net loss.Metrics used to determine substantive change include: proved reserves, annual production, net income, cashflow, fixed and variable operational costs, finding and development costs and capital efficiencies.  These metrics are reviewed annually.  Due to variable economic parameters, specific thresholds used to determine substantiveness vary by operational area. Enerplus defines substantive applicable to direct operation only.
A substantive change from water risk would include impacts to operations or expenditures due to water availability or cost that would drive financial performance results for the year significantly outside the forecasted ranges (i.e. guidance).
Substantive change would be one that significantly impacts operations or has a material financial impact such as a cooling water system retrofit, if mandated by the permitting authority, or it could also be the potential for shareholder or customer concern, or a combination resulting in a larger impact. The basis for expressing the percentage of operation affected is based on plants identified using WRI AqueDuct risk mapping plus our own plant specific information. The calculation is: total net generation MWh of the facilities located in water stress regions divided by the total net generation MWh produced by the generation facilities over which Exelon has operational control.  This percentage does not include operations related to the marketing and distribution of energy or natural gas, which have less significant water uses. Exelon Corporation compiles an enterprise-wide inventory of water withdrawals and associated discharges annually. Exelon used the WRI AqueDuct to screen for potential geographic water scarcity. All facilities identified in the screening process as being potentially located in water scarce areas were further evaluated using internal company knowledge and regional basin management information to confirm the model output.  The WRI AqueDuct uses twelve global maps grouped into physical, quantity, quality, and regulatory and reputational risk. The seven physical quantity risks include: baseline water stress; inter-annual variability; seasonal variability; floods; drought severity; upstream storage and groundwater. Physical water quality risks include return flow ratio and upstream protected land. The three regulatory and reputational risks include media coverage, access to water and threatened amphibians. Overall water risk assessment identifies areas with higher exposure to these water-related risks and is an aggregated measure. In the past Exelon used the UNEP water stress map: http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/jpg/0221-waterstress-EN.jpg which shows that Exelon has no operations in water stressed areas based on the UNEP definition (less than 1700 cubic meters per person per year). WRI’s new AqueDuct assessment tool is far broader in its definition of water stress, and therefore identifies some areas where we operate that are subject to water stress as defined in the multivariate analyses in the WRI AqueDuct tool.

As a large logistics company with many sites spread throughout the globe, we are relatively well protected from site specific changes and/or disruptions. To protect from these risks, we haveaddressed business interruption and contingency planning at several levels within our organization (facilities, data processing, and operations). We have a business continuity plan and crisis management teams to manage the critical products and services we provide for our customers. With these teams, we have the ability to immediately respond to any potential risk to our business operations. If a facility were to experience a major event, Expeditors has a disaster recovery site and redundant data center located in a geographically different location from our corporate headquarters which would allow us to resume operations within this facility should the need arise within our global network. We assess and mitigate risk surrounding disaster recovery of our systems through systems health monitoring, forecasting and diagnostics.

Water is essential to FirstEnergy's ability to generate electricity, as many of our plants use water for steam production and plant cooling purposes.  Costs could be incurred in the future due to more stringent water regulations and/or availability of sufficient quantity and quality of freshwater.
Natural disasters such as floods and disruptions to our utility water supply that affect a plant's ability to produce and perform process development activities are water risks that could generate substantive change to our business. These risks would likely result in us losing some production for a while, until we are able to bring the affected buildings back to production. Substantive risk is defined in terms of its impact on our overall production. Of the 3.1GW produced in 2016, our manufacturing facility in Ohio represented approximately 17% while operations in Malaysia represent 83%. In addition to manufacturing thin film solar photovoltaic modules, First Solar also develops, finances, engineers, constructs, and operates some of the world’s largest PV power plants. The successful development and construction of solar energy generation facilities is contingent upon, securing necessary water rights for project construction and operation, among other things. Water shortages in regions where we develop and construct PV projects could adversely affect, delay and/or render the successful completion of a particular project infeasible.

The risk to our operations is strictly due to interruption or curtailment, as opposed to the cost of water. Although most of our business processes do not consume large quantities of water, we do require sufficient supply in order to run our business. If our operations were to experience an event where we could not receive ample water, in the form of interruption, we would face significant limits to production. During our risk assessment, we concluded that the facilities that consume the largest percentage of water are not in water stressed regions. The ability to source water in a reliable fashion impacts both our direct operations, and our supply chain, because both rely on water in order to function.

Our analysis of Ford operations shows that some of our facilities are located in regions where water supplies are already scarce. Global climate change also has the potential to further impact the quality and availability of water. We cannot be certain that we will always have access to water of the quantity and quality that our operations require. Our water strategy puts primary emphasis on our plants located in areas of water scarcity. Ford is committed to conserving water and using it responsibly. We will address water challenges internally within our own operations and externally in communities where we operate and throughout our supply chain. We have committed to measureable actions to support our global water strategy. In deciding which facilities and which basins concern Ford, aggregate scores from the Global Water Tool (subwatershed level) were used alongside internal knowledge of specific facilities and local watersheds. If a facility had a high risk or projected risk by the tools, it was listed. The operating facilities listed as “substantive” had to have a high stress or risk and have a production or support production of greater than 1% of global relevant production (vehicle, engines, or transmissions). This definition of risk applies to Ford’s direct operations.  For supply chain, we utilized a different methodology to determine water risks that could generate a potential impact to our supply chain. Suppliers are selected to participate in the CDP Supply Chain water questionnaire based on a combination of factors including those that supply water-intensive commodities, those with operations in water-stressed areas (as determined using the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and Maplecroft tool), and the business relationship to Ford. We repeat our assessment of selected suppliers in light of developments in these three areas on an annual basis. The ongoing data obtained through the CDP surveys has helped us identify “hotspots” for GHG emissions and water use. These suppliers have been targeted to participate in the Partnership for a Cleaner Environment (PACE) program whereby Ford will share leading practices for water use reductions with these suppliers to reduce our collective environmental footprint.

Substantive changes from water risks in our supply chain include those that could have a substantial impact on our business results or reputation with key stakeholders. These could include disruptions in our ability to source products or increases in product costs due to risks such as water scarcity, quality, pollution, drought or flooding. They could also include reputation risks due to the impact of water-related risks that affect the well-being of the people who make our clothes or local communities. These reputation risks could adversely affect consumers' perceptions of our brands and lead to lower demand for our products.

We perform an ongoing assessment of a variety of risks impacting our business.  As part of that process, we consider potential financial impacts over the near term and longer time horizons.  Our risk analysis includes potential costs associated with increased or volatile commodity prices (and other related costs) resulting from water risks as well as risk of water supply restrictions to facilities.  Risks are evaluated based on the total financial impact relative to the size of our business and the likelihood of those risks coming to fruition.
For direct operations, GM defines substantive change in their business to be when more than 20% of operating production could be impacted at a company level for ongoing operations (for example an impact to 2 million vehicles of production). The Chief Risk Officer of GM is Mary Barra, also Chairman and CEO. The Risk Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing GM’s management of enterprise-level risks.    Additionally, during new construction planning, the site planning team considers substantive risk as inadequate water supply for direct operations to meet 100% design operating production volumes.While the risks related to water at any individual GM facility are not substantive to GM in total, our operations in Mexico at San Luis Potosi, Silao, and Ramos Arizpe were identified as substantive during the site planning phase and corrective actions to mitigate the water risks were implemented prior to production start.  This includes additional spending for water reuse to meet production water supply requirements, even at the extreme level of Zero Liquid Discharge at one facility, to minimize the impact to GM's operations and the local community. For supply chain operations, GM has performed life cycle analysis of water consumption of all suppliers and used water consumption information to identify the top 100 suppliers by overall risk using WRI Aqueduct model.  Although 4% showed high risk, our experience with current operations show that there is not a substantive risk due to water for these suppliers. To engage these high risk and other strategic suppliers, GM joined CDP Water supply chain in 2014, continuing in 2015-6 and invited all of our strategic suppliers, including the high risk suppliers to engage them in water risk management.

The unavailability of clean water will directly impact our ability to produce our products and sanitize our facilities.  We would either have to bring in water to overcome temporary interruptions in supply or relocate operations.
Substantive changes include a decrease or stoppage of production, or a significant increase in expenditures from water risk that is expected long term.

In the context of the CDP Water response, Goodyear interprets a substantive change as the inability to manufacture tires in accordance with Goodyear's long-term strategy. This relates to direct operations and the measure would include the prevention of growing production by one tire or more, meaning any growth prevented directly by water-related issues. This metric is reviewed annually as a part of the global water risk assessment and is included in the overall water risk assessment plans.

This metric is reviewed annually as a part of the global water risk assessment and is included in the overall water risk assessment plans.

Substantive risks to our direct operations are those that impact our ability to successfully deliver products to our customers in a timely manner. Risks are prioritized based on severity and probability, allowing us to focus on those risks that are the most likely to have a considerable financial impact.Our production facilities monitor and report potential site-specific risks monthly, and company-wide assessments are completed annually. Each assessment follows a standard methodology that evaluates the frequency and severity of potential risks, including several climate related risks, such as sea level rise and flooding. These scores are ranked based on a scale of likelihood and severity, and the top potential risks make up management priorities for the upcoming period. Additionally, we work closely with our customers to understand their concerns and meet all risk mitigation requirements, including coordinating customer audits of relevant facilities.
Substantive change is defined as change that could materially impact revenues or costs. For example by curtailing operations such as hydraulic fracturing, or by restricting access to a crucial supply chain input such as fresh water or guar.
A substantive change is defined by Caesars as any risk that may impose one or more of the following: 1) physical damage, 2) increased regulatory constraints, or 3) impacts to operations, services, and revenues. The following thresholds have been identified for each type of substantive change: 1) a repair or replacement costing Caesars more than $25k -- the threshold for capital funds approval 2) any regulatory constraints that prohibit the use of our swimming pools, golf courses or impact the availability of water to provide fully-functioning WASH services, 3) an interruption in utility service, or one day of lost revenue at any Caesars property. This definition is inclusive of indirect impacts to operations, services and revenue through the supply chain. If a reduction in supply impacts menus for more than 5 business days, this would be considered substantive. If suppliers and alternative suppliers increase the cost of their goods or services by 8%, this would be considered substantive. Any amount of negative media attention would be considered substantive, as negative media attention will negatively affect the Caesars brand. We assess sites and supply chain categories at risk every year and determine which of these thresholds maybe in peril according to the WRI aqueduct tool and each sites water use. Additionally groups throughout the organization review each threshold on a regular basis as part of their responsibilities.

For CDP, Hilton defines substantive water risk as the exposure of Hilton’s owned or managed hotels to risks which may potentially impact the hotel’s ability to operate or provide required fresh water required for employees and guest service in the future.  While the overall WWF risk assessment is conducted on all hotels globally, the definition of substantive risk applies to owned and managed hotel assets where Hilton has a greater financial interest.  The substantive risk metric or indicator used is the WWF Average Basin Risk, which defines high-risk facilities as those with a final basin-related risk score of 4.0 or greater.  Related high-risk indicators for the individual facilities are also evaluated (scarcity, drought, flooding, pollution, regulatory, etc.) to identify key drivers and challenges to be addressed through property operations and Hilton’s Water Stewardship initiatives.  Hotels with a WWF final basin-related risk score of 3.50-3.99 are typically defined as moderate risk, and thus not included in Hilton’s responses for W3 and W5.  However, these hotels are screened in greater detail and we consider hotels within the same river basin with moderate to high water risk as “substantive risk” for reporting purposes at the basin level (i.e., Yangtze River, China).To clarify, hotels collectively ranked as high-risk do not represent a substantive impact to Hilton’s overall global business, operations, revenue or expenditure. Out of the total 4600 hotels evaluated, a total of 242 hotels (5%) had a basin risk score of 3.5 or greater.  For owned and managed only, a total of 124 hotels had a basin risk score of 3.5 or greater (approximately 2.5% of the global portfolio/revenues or 17% of the owned and managed portfolio).  Out of these 124 hotels, 21 hotels in China, Egypt and India had a basin risk score of 4.0 or greater (less than 1% of the global portfolio or 3% of the owned and managed portfolio).  While minimal impact, this approach helps us better understand challenges in specific areas in order to identify potential opportunities for Hilton’s water stewardship initiatives. Of the 218 hotels with a basin risk between 3.50-3.99, over 50% are franchised properties. The vast majority (106/115) of these franchised hotels are located in Mexico and U.S. regions that have experienced severe drought in recent years (California, Texas, Nevada, New Mexico).

Hudbay Minerals identifies substantive change as a significant impact on the economics of a project or operation that would result in a substantial additional capital investment or a significant deterioration in the financial return on an existing investment.
Husky's enterprise risk management program supports decision-making via comprehensive and systematic identification and assessment of risks that could materially impact the results of the Company. Through this framework, the Company builds risk management and mitigation into strategic planning and operational processes for its business units through the adoption of standards and best practices. Husky has developed an enterprise risk matrix to identify risks to its people, the environment, its assets and its reputation, and to systematically mitigate these risks to an acceptable level. Husky defines substantive change as having a financial impact of greater than ten (10) million dollars.The corporate risk register is revisited on at least an annual basis, while the matrix is evaluated every three years.
Based on the nature and scope of our business operations and our interaction with suppliers, IBM does not perceive any unusual water-related risks in our operations or the supply chain outside of those we plan for as part of our ongoing business and risk management processes. These risk management processes look at business risk comprehensively including, but not limited to, risks and impacts related to water use and discharge. We anticipate that the business models of both IBM’s and our production and service suppliers’ operations will enable those operations to anticipate and adapt to potential risks and mitigate the impacts without significant disruptions to our business. This risk management approach is primarily achieved through implementation of the IBM global Environmental Management System, established for over 40 years, which is integrated into our business operations.

Intel’s Board of Directors and management consider “risk” for these purposes to be the possibility that an undesired event could occur that might adversely affect the achievement of our objectives. The types of risks that Intel faces include:• Macro-economic risks such as inflation, reductions in economic growth, or recession• Political risks such as restrictions on access to markets, confiscatory taxation, and expropriation of assets• Physical risks such as natural disasters (e.g., floods, prolonged drought, etc.)• Business-specific risks related to strategic position, operational execution, financial structure, legal and regulatory compliance, corporate governance, and environmental stewardship• Reputational risks, such as the community's perception of how we manage our water, particularly in times of prolonged drought• Regulatory risks, such as changing regulations that could limit the amount of water used or increase our costs related to water usageWe define a "substantive change" related to water-risk as a change that would impact or influence our business (output or revenue). This is measured through various indicators such as interpretation of public perception (Public Affairs team), potential for any water disruption (Global Supply Management team), potential for legal costs (Public Affairs and Sustainability or EHS Legal Team), or any noticeable impact on our business (revenue impacts or the inability to work in certain areas of the world). The thresholds we use to determine if something would be considered a substantive change include any impacts to production capabilities or resulting revenues, damages to our public image, and changing regulations that would limit our ability for growth or incur a significant cost (such as new water-related costs that could increase operating costs by several million dollars per site). These criteria apply to our direct operations as well as our ability to continue working with our major suppliers.

When prioritizing risks and opportunities our strategic pillars are the starting point.  However, we do identify natural disasters and other climate related exposures as part of our process.  As it relates to prioritization, consideration is also given to the following items:  impact; both internal and external influences; our current capability and prior experience in mitigating such risks; as well as our expectations of the future outlook for the identified risk.   For our operations, we define water-related risks that could cause ‘substantive’ change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure as those which could impact our strategic sites located in areas of “High” or “Extremely High” overall water risk as defined by WRI Aqueduct. Our strategic sites are those that are critical to operations such as our manufacturing facilities or corporate headquarters. Each site is reviewed annually through WRI Aqueduct and assessed in terms of overall water risk, business growth and strategy. To date, we have not identified a water-related risk for our strategic sites which could cause a substantive change in our business.

Interruption of production could present a change, depending on the product(s) impacted. This change could be substantive, due to the customer need for the product, the revenue we derive from the product, and/or the expenditure required to prevent interruption or to restore production.*Note: CDP's phrasing of "substantive" and our response to questions presenting "substantive" risks should not be considered to relate to matters or facts that could be deemed “material” to a reasonable investor as referred to under U.S. securities laws or similar requirements of other jurisdictions.

A risk management working team is maintained to assess and report overall strategic and operational risks found in our operations and supply chain. When risks hit certain material thresholds or causes substantive change, the committee reports those risks to company management and the board of directors.Juniper prioritizes risks found to be material. Materiality of an issue is assessed as follows:• The value, or risk, of the issue to business operations: Using our corporate strategy, Juniper looks at whether the issue represents a significant risk or opportunity to our company or industry? Is it current or emerging? Is it already part of the Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability strategy or does it need to be added? • The priority of the issue to our stakeholders: Does this issue resonate with our key stakeholders? Is it a subject of NGO campaigns? How does it track in the media? Is it reflected in pending legislation, regulations, or international agreements?• Peers & competitors: Do Juniper’s peers and competitors disclose against this issue? How do they respond?• Juniper’s influence over the issue: To what extent does Juniper have control or influence over the issue through our direct actions, industry associations, or networks?• Relevant and applicable voluntary global reporting and corporate social responsibility standards and guidelines: Is the issue addressed by the standard disclosures of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct, or by other relevant and applicable global voluntary standards?Juniper’s approach to materiality is aligned with the domain solutions & customer verticals of our business strategy. The strategy (referred to as our 2-3-7 strategy) provides a structure & hierarchy for prioritizing the value, or risk, of an issue on Juniper’s business operations. It is based on the following approach: Is this issue critical to our customer segments (Telecom, Financial Services, Cable/MSO, National Government, Cloud Providers & Strategic Enterprise Verticals)? Is this issue relevant to our product domains (Campus & Branch, Access & Aggregation, Edge, Core, Data Center, & Cloud Services)?  Risks found to be material are then acted on through various management methods.

Kellogg defines substantive change as including but not limited to plant relocation, curtailment of operations, product relocation, interruptions in availability, increased cost for municipal water, increased cost for raw materials, lack of security of supply of raw materials, and significant investment in water reduction/recycling. The metrics for this would include increased costs, lack of availability causing shut downs, and increased water treatment. The threshold for these indicators would vary from facility to facility but would be assessed against profit and loss and operational budgets. This covers both operations and supply chain.

Kimberly-Clark's tissue business is water intensive and relies significantly on the availability of adequate supplies. We define Substantive Change as any interruption in the water supply that would directly curtail production and force the shutdown of the facility until the water supply is restored. For any expansion or new greenfield site, the availability of adequate fresh water supply is very important. Because of this, all new expansions or new tissue machines will employ state-of-the-art water conservation technologies, and, new wastewater plants will employ the latest technology in water recycling. These efforts incur a higher expenditure than traditional technologies. The threshold for substantive change and risk is 1% or more of global production capacity, which applies to direct operations. The risk is evaluated annually and the risk mitigation plan is implemented and adjusted based on the analysis. Since water reporting began, there have been no water-related business or operational issues greater than the 1% production threshold.

Although an official end to the drought has been declared, Kingston will continue to use conservation gained from the drought in California.  Taiwan is also experiencing drought effects.  Changes to the business would only be affected by water usage and restrictions for personnel on-site.  Water is minimally used in the production process for stencil cleaning, and alternative methodologies for replacing stenciling requiring water cleaning continue and expected to be realized in the next year or two.

Lockheed Martin considers water-related risks to be location specific but currently does not deem water to pose a material impact to our business. For the purposes of Water CDP disclosure, we would define substantive change from water-related risks as those that are present within certain regions where we or key suppliers operate that could lead to a 1% deviation from normal business operations (e.g. increased process time, disrupted material flow, supply chain delay, etc.) and/or a change in revenue or costs to the affected facility and/or supplier caused by a water shortage, regulatory water restriction, water-related natural catastrophe, or other water-related impact. Water impacts currently do not constitute 1% of deviation in our normal business operations or our supply chain, and thus do not constitute a substantive change.Lockheed Martin is not in a water intensive industry and therefore does not encounter conflicts with other water users at a local level. Our current water quantity and quality meet our demands without materially impacting the water basins in which we operate. If water were to be identified by our stakeholders in our Core Issues Assessment as a high priority factor, we would consider evolving our definition of substantive change to reflect our stakeholders’ concerns and address specific water issues with targeted goals. We will continue to evaluate whether our internal and external stakeholders consider water to be a material impact in the future.

We consider sites that are consistently measured as high risk against three separate criteria to represent a substantive water-related risk to the business. We regard these sites as high priorities for our water stewardship program. The criteria are:1) Sites experiencing the greatest water-related risks and issues as identified in our annual watershed governance survey (see Further Information, below).2) Sites in locations of high (>40%) baseline water stress as per the WRI Aqueduct tool. 3) Sites producing more than 5% of global production volume for one of our Chocolate, Drinks, Food or businesses. For our Petcare business, which has far more sites, we identify those producing more than 2% of total production volume. The proportion of production volume is an indicator of potential business impact in the event of water issues affecting a factory’s ability to operate.Sites identified as high-risk against the above three criteria are the subject of a water stewardship review to ensure we have a detailed understanding of local water risks and opportunities. We are currently developing this process, with a pilot in progress at the Food segment’s Kings Lynn site in the UK and two further reviews underway at two sites in China. We aim to complete this review at existing high-priority locations before year-end 2020, and at all new production sites from 2017 onward.Four sites identified as "at risk" in our 2016 response are not considered "at risk" this year. These sites were in Belgium (Schelde), US (Mississippi), Australia and the UK (unknown watersheds). These sites have addressed their issues of concern as described in the "response strategy" area of our 2016 response, and their risk level has been downgraded according to the criteria described above. In our supply chain, we have overlaid our raw material origins with watersheds, to cross-reference water-intensive crops with areas of water stress to identify priority watersheds that present a substantive supply risk. We have used the results to develop science-based targets for reducing water impacts, based on sustainable watershed levels. More information on this approach is available at www.wri.org/blog/2016/04/companies-could-profit-setting-water-targets-informed-science.

Water risk assessment ongoing. Risks identified only for few facilities owned and operated by Micron. We will report a full risk assessment next year
Risk assessments completed to date have determined that at present our business is not exposed to water risks that could generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure. Substantive change for offices/labs would require significantly altering, closing or relocating the operations of a facility/group of facilities. This could include impacts on employees and/or technology equipment. Our operational analysis includes a 3-part filter to identify those facilities representing the greatest potential risk: 1) location in water basins with current or future potential for high baseline water stress; 2) annual average electricity use >60 kWh/square foot (large electricity users being datacenters); and 3) if the facility represents >1% of total companywide electricity use (using electricity as proxy for the size or relative importance of the facility to our company). We review our approach annually when we respond to the CDP water questionnaire, reassessing our risk assessment procedures and looking for opportunities to formalize/integrate risk assessments across the company. Similarly, substantive change for datacenters would entail the need to significantly alter, close or relocate a datacenter in response to water risk that would affect our ability to deliver continuous customer services. We engage all utilities (water/sewer/power/fiber) during site selection due diligence. Capacity and quality are vetted and service agreements put in place prior to completing the transaction. Where future expansion plans are unknown, we obtain commitment letters from the utilities indicating they can provide for future demand (often subject to expansion of existing infrastructure). We do not locate datacenters where utility constraints would prevent us from operating those facilities.Risk for manufacturing sites is defined per our ISO 14001 Significant Aspects and Impacts process and is not considered substantive.These definitions apply to direct operations only. In FY16, we initiated a comprehensive company-wide assessment of vulnerabilities to the physical impacts of climate change (including sea-level rise, flooding from intense precipitation, drought frequency/intensity), focusing on a subset of high-value facilities in locations likely subject to these impacts; once complete, the findings will be integrated into future risk assessments.

A substantive change to our organization for both our direct operation and supply chain is one that is material to the company. To understand the potential for substantive change, our risk identification and assessment process goes through a multi-pronged approach.  We rate risks on factors such as impact, severity, frequency, and likelihood.  We temper this with a look into our controls/mitigations in place or in process.  This process is conducted on an ongoing basis, but reported out to the executives on a quarterly cadence.  Our rating scale has several elements such as financial impact, regulatory, customer impact, reputational, etc. Water related risks including water scarcity and extreme storms are included in these analyses of the potential for substantive risk. For example, droughts, such as the one that was in California or the current one in Bangalore could have an impact on operating expenses at our Sunnyvale facility (if tiered water rates change) as well as on capital expenditures if we are required to retrofit some of our existing cooling towers to reduce the consumption of domestic water. In addition, water availability could affect the prices of our components, since a number of our suppliers (e.g., semiconductor manufacturers) can use significant amounts of water in their manufacturing processes.
A substantive change to our organization for both our direct operation and supply chain is one that is material to the company. To understand the potential for substantive change, our risk identification and assessment process goes through a multi-pronged approach.  We rate risks on factors such as impact, severity, frequency, and likelihood.  We temper this with a look into our controls/mitigations in place or in process.

Substantive change is defined as a significant operation change or expenditure greater than $1 million. Elements of substantive change include the following:- Rapidly increasing social, political and media concern leading to project delays, increased costs- Increasing pressure on water use due to in-migration of communities in proximity to our operations that could impact our operations- Water scarcity and water surplus leading to production constraints and increased costs- Increasingly stringent regulations focused on water management and discharge requirements leading to increased costs- Increasing financial exposure at closure due to increasingly stringent regulations and water treatment costs

We produce aluminum sheet and light gauge products for use in multiple markets, which includes beverage can.  Our single largest end-use market is beverage can sheet. The beverage market is highly dependent on fresh clean water as a key raw material, within the manufacturing process and other product ingredients.  Certain of our customers in the beverage market are significant to our revenues, and we could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of these significant customers or by the loss of their business.
NRG’s definition of substantive water risk is the possibility that an event will occur and significantly alter the achievement of NRG’s business goals.  Risk identification and assessment process applies to both direct operations and supply chain.NRG uses the measures, metrics and indicators for water risk assessment leveraging the management and professional judgment from the following perspectives:•Financial impact:    1)Corporate earnings   2)Capital expenditure on technologies to reduce water consumption and withdrawal •Plant operation    1)Operation disruption due to water shortage   2)Increase in costs of water usage   3)Supply chain risk•Environmental impact   1)Water availability    3)Water quality of river basins   4)Regulations that impact supply and/or management of waterWater risk is monitored by the risk owners (individual plant operators) and reported to management upon material changes with a threshold of 20% in water consumption and withdrawal levels.  If it is determined that a water supply risk exists that could impact projected generation levels within any plant within the subsequent two year time frame, risk mitigation efforts are identified and economically evaluated for implementation.  NRG receives some of our solid and liquid fuel by barge delivery. Water risk regarding the impact for barge delivery is evaluated on a daily basis, with contingency plans developed as needed.  NRG SVP, Plant Operations reviews modelling scenarios generated for water risk determination.Plant level NRG Water usage analysis is reviewed annually.NRG water usage analysis is reviewed by the senior leaders of NRG Operations, Engineering and Commercial Operations.

We have established financial thresholds for determining 'substantive' change for the purposes of CDP reporting. These thresholds take in to account direct operations and supply chain. Impacts in any given quarter of above $7M in revenue loss and/or $4M in additional Cost of Goods Sold or Operating Expenses, are considered substantive.

Water quality and quantity both represents risks and opportunities.  Water is used throughout the project life-cycle of oil and gas activities, for our chemical production and power generation and is core to business continuity. Oxy's HESMS and risk management approach identifies, assesses and grades significant (actual and potential) water-related risks. The HESMS sets consistent worldwide performance expectations and standards across each business segment's respective operations. The HESMS facilitates compliance with laws and regulations and the management of HES and water risks to improve overall business performance. Oxy manages its own water use consistent with community interests near our operations and to avoid adversely impacting the environment, or our license to operate in these communities. Oxy works with IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues. Through a combination of practical tools, reporting practices and working group forums for sharing industry knowledge, IPIECA enables the oil and gas industry to proactively identify potential water risks and to manage water issues.  For example, water scarcity is a prominent issue in the Permian Basin (West Texas and Southeast New Mexico) where, as reported by the U.S. Geologic Society and Texas Alliance, the majority of oil and gas wells are in a “high or extremely high water stress area.” These prevailing water scarcity risks are factored into Oxy’s business plans and water use strategy to operationalize and mitigate risks, and also to identify and seize opportunities that could provide costs savings or generate revenues. Our current oil and gas development plans factor the risk associated with future scarcity of fresh water, especially in Southeast New Mexico. Investing in solutions to treat a larger capacity of produced water delivers value to our operations. We mitigate safety-related risks and save money from minimizing the handling/trucking of water, disposal costs and providing operational continuity to treat large volumes of water if a disposal system goes down.Oxy’s social responsibility website and the Form 10-K provides a detailed discussion of risk factors, including those which can be water-related such as governmental actions, climate change and catastrophic events (hurricanes, floods and droughts).
Omnicom Group and its subsidiaries is a professional services company. We do not use water beyond what is normally used in an office setting, ie restrooms, water fountains & kitchens.

Operations at a few plants require a significant quantity of water. Therefore, water related risks have the potential to cause substantial change in direct business operations. Depending on severity and the likelihood of water challenges derived from the watershed/basin, it might impact local business units as well as revenue or expenditure at global level. To determine the included facilities we identify all sites listed as having "high" or "extremely high" overall water risk from the Aqueduct Tool.  We then cross reference that with our water use and production levels at each of those sites. To be considered significant the total amount of production from those sites within the basin must be above 3%. Once plants cross both the high risk and 3% production in the basin threshold they are considered to have the potential of substantive change on our business. We use our supplier segmentation process to identify those suppliers that are critical to our operations based on a variety of risk factors including availability of substitutions and level of spend. Based on the results of the segmentation process suppliers representing 87% of our spend go through additional water risk assessments including the Aqueduct Tool.

PepsiCo incorporates the following factors when defining substantive change in PepsiCo’s direct operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk: 1) magnitude of potential impact on operating costs and/or current and future revenue; and 2) potential impact on stakeholder expectations or perceptions.  Substantive change would generally be considered any material change (+/- 5%) to a site's operating environment/costs and/or to PepsiCo reputation locally, regionally or globally.  Should such material change occur, the impact (and any potential need to review the definition) would be reviewed and re-assessed by our senior executive team.  This definition of substantive change applies to both direct operations and to elements of our supply chain (such as change to agricultural raw material sourcing from water-related risks).

These apply to both our direct operations and our tobacco supply chain.Over the last couple of years, we have been expanding our water programs by first assessing current and future water-related risks more broadly across our value chain. These risks include water scarcity and water quality in tobacco growing regions, flood risk in major tobacco warehouse locations and ports, and water demand in cities where we have manufacturing facilities.
APS defines substantive change to our business related to water risk in three ways.  First, a physical disruption of a water supply constitutes a substantive and disruptive change.  If a vital piece of infrastructure is damaged or becomes inoperable, output could be impacted or generation could be curtailed entirely. Second, noncompliance with a permit or regulatory requirement could impact production and/or result notices of violations and penalties. Finally, allocation cuts related to water shortages would impact production.

Substantive change from water related risks would mainly relate to water availability for use in our phosphate operations and water-related regulatory requirements (mainly water quality/discharges). Substantive change would be considered a change in the water supply availability which could impact production levels and product availability which could cause a deviation from the company’s desired strategic results. Substantive change related to water-related regulatory requirements would include international, federal and state regulatory initiatives that may result in new regulatory restrictions on discharges of nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, to waters in the United States (“Nutrient Criteria”). These Nutrient Criteria could have a material effect on either the Company or its customers, but the impact is not currently predictable or quantifiable with reasonable certainty because many of these initiatives are in relatively early stages and compliance alternatives may be available that do not create material impacts.

A substantive change for both our direct operations and our supply chain is one that is material to the company. When conducting a risk assessment to identify material risks, we consider the scale of the potential financial impact and the likelihood of the impact on our key business drivers, including employee attraction and retention, future growth strategy, innovation, meeting customers’ needs, and supply chain management.

A substantive impact would be defined as one that would impact our operations to the point where we could not meet our customers' needs.  This would be defined as us not being able to meet our production quotas due to water risks or lack of availability.  This would apply to our suppliers and our direct operations.  We do not see a current or near term risk in our water scarce area operations.  We recognize that in many cases, our suppliers are located in the same watersheds as our operations.  We recognize we must work to encourage our suppliers to also minimize their water usage.

 Rockwell defines substantive change to our business to be when more than 5% of operations, revenue or expenditure is impacted, at the corporate level. This threshold is then applied to reporting water-related substantive risks. For example, if a supply-chain is disrupted as a result of prolonged drought in one region and this contributes to a reduction in production globally but it is less than 5% at the corporate level. Consequently this risk would NOT be reported in question W3.2d as an example of a water risk that could cause a substantive change to business, operations, revenue or expenditure as it did not exceed the threshold for substantive change to our business at the corporate level.

Sempra Energy’s 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission identifies the risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.  The 10-K identifies a few risk factors that are or could be a result of water-related issues, particularly drought.   However, for transparency purposes, in this response we have also included additional water-related risks that we have identified.  These risks do not meet the threshold of materiality relevant to our 10-K filing, but we believe are useful in providing to context to the significance of water in our operations and supply chain and therefore merit inclusion in this discussion.

For instance, if it was impossible to provide sufficient drinking water to workers and offices needed to be evacuated or activities on construction site would have to stop.To date, the main water related risk SNC-Lavalin has been exposed to is floods. In the past years urban areas where we have permanent offices such as Calgary and Houston have been severely impacted by floods. In addition, major clients' projects were completed in arid regions such as mines in Chile and smelters in UAE. In those cases, sustainable sources of water needed to be assessed both for the construction and operation phases of the designed facilities.
Without continuous flow of water at least one of our facilities is not able to operate

Sprint believes there are some risks associated with water, but does not believe these risks are material (per SEC reporting guidelines). In Sprint's direct operations, water is used in evaporative chiller systems to cool data centers, and large network and commercial office locations. Sprint defines substantive change from water risk as a forced replacement of operational equipment with alternative technology. “Substantive change” is based on the Base Water Stress level (2010) obtained by inputting data about Sprint's sites into WBCSD's Global Water Tool used to identify water stressed in river basins associated with our US based operations. We combined our facility water usage information with the information from WBCSD and found that 14 of Sprint’s top 50 water usage sites (76% of its consumption in 2016) are in extremely high water stressed areas. Through Sprint's Trucost analyses in recent years, we also have been able to assess the scope of water consumed in its supply chain. Sprint's supply chain accounts for more than 99% of the company's overall water footprint.

Substantive change for our business as it relates to water availability would be lack of water necessary to conduct our manufacturing operations in a manner that complies with all applicable food safety regulatory requirements and standards.  Lack of water could be from on-site sources or from water supply sources, and could include significant curtailment of typical water supply needed to run the operation.  Another aspect of risk would be the ability to obtain ingredients that rely on adequate water supply for crop harvesting to meet production based on customer demands.

Union Pacific integrates water risks/opportunities into a multi-disciplinary Company-wide risk management process. Union Pacific utilizes an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process to incorporate input from Strategic Planning, Operations, Law, and the Environmental Management Group, among others, to identify potential water related risks and opportunities. Each element plays a role in the management of risks and opportunities and evaluation of materiality and priorities. In each case, the criteria for materiality and priorities are dictated first and foremost by an analysis of impacts to safety. Evaluation of impacts to ethics, customer service, and the environment also dictate materiality and priorities. These criteria and priorities are not mutually exclusive and overlap. Union Pacific assesses these impacts in terms of likelihood and magnitude of the impact, determines a response strategy, and monitors progress.

Changes in precipitation patterns result in drought or flood conditions that will impact landfill function, not only in terms of additional costs to maintain operations but also will impact potential revenues from the collection and use of landfill gas for energy. Virtually any of WM’s landfills in the U.S. and Canada are vulnerable to intermittent drought conditions, flood conditions or both.Both flooding and drought impact the behaviors of materials decaying in a controlled MSW landfill environment. Flooding can impede the collection of landfill gas by filling collection wells with water; drought can reduce the rate of decay of organic material because water is essential to the decay process. Both extreme conditions result in additional labor being required to manage the landfill gas collection system, with additional liquids collection required to respond to excess moisture and with adjustments to gas collection system vacuum required to respond to the decrease in gas generation resulting from too little moisture. Also, additional labor and costs are incurred in compliance with regulatory obligations. Also, although WM is not a high volume water user, temporary disruptions in water supply could affect our operations.

WhiteWave employs a multi-disciplinary approach to risk management, with a Board of Directors (BOD) that reviews opportunities or risks identified by our Executive Leadership Team as part of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program (financial, regulatory, compliance, etc.) that would materially impact our objectives. ERM and the Risk Management Oversight Committee (RMOC) in N. America provide periodic updates to executive leadership discussing supply chain issues if they occur/when needed. The Risk Refresh is an annual process where the risk portfolio and risk profiles are reviewed, discussed and tiered based on prioritization methodology. Risks are considered as far into the future as reasonably possible. Sustainability updates are presented to the BOD after the annual environmental inventory is performed and as needed. Lastly, a cross-functional Issues Working Group (IWG) meets monthly to review emerging and ongoing issues affecting our brands, business & industry.For purposes of this survey, we used a screening criteria to identify our direct operational sites and key ingredient suppliers meeting the CDP guidance for "substantive" as follows: 1) sites indicated as "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk per WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter, and 2) which are either considered strategic sites or those which account for >5% of global production volume.
There are not constraints on our operations related to water use due to our Great Lakes basin and Mississippi River basin operating locations. Therefore, we do not have metrics used to define substantive change to our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk.

Assuming a lead role in sustainability requires a focused effort on aspects that will drive the greatest value to our stakeholders and company and we utilize materiality assessments to prioritize this effort. Xerox’s formal CSR materiality assessment process considers relevant sustainability/CSR topics impacting Xerox products, services, processes and operations, including water in our operations and supply chain. Each topic is assessed for both importance to our stakeholders as well as significance of positive and negative impacts to the economy/society/environment from Xerox’s operations, products and facilities. Each topic is given a numerical score against the criteria to aid prioritization. Results are presented via a matrix so the importance of the topics can be visually presented. Subject matter experts are identified for all the high risk/opportunity issues and are responsible for defining and implementing necessary actions to respond to the issues identified. We prioritize the risks in terms of current risk profile as well as the projected risk profile on completion of the risk mitigation plans. Opportunities are prioritized on relative effort (measured by cost, time and intangibles) and benefit (measured by revenue opportunity, reduced liability and intangibles). In 2016 water was identified as a low risk material aspect.However, we have identified specific facilities within our direct operations exposed to water risk that could generate “a substantive change in our business operations, revenue or expenditure” based on meeting the following criteria:1.Facility locations classified as water stressed or water scarce according to publically available water tools (WBCSD Global Water Tool, WWF Water Risk Filter and WRI Aqueduct)2.Consideration of internal company knowledge (e.g. from the materiality processes described above) regarding the local water situation, the facility type, size and strategic importance and thus potential to impact/reduce global revenue (i.e. the Technology business represents ~60% total global revenue). E.g toner manufacturing operations use water as raw material and thus, in the event of a future water restriction, have the potential for operations to be impacted resulting in potential additional costs associated with switching toner production to an alternative site. Also large office/R&D facilities (i.e. >100 employees)

We assess water risk according to the potential impact on any of our major generating facilities. To the extent that water risks may inhibit the ability of any of our major units to deliver reliable electricity to the market and meet market demand, that risk is considered to have a potential to create substantive change.  We assess water risk including drought, flooding, availability, and quality risks that could impact our ability to operate reliably.

To define a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk, we consider an estimated potential financial impact in excess of $5 million as a threshold quantitative metric. In evaluating and estimating the potential financial impact, we consider numerous factors, including the proportion of business units affected, size of the impact on those business units, and degree of stakeholder concern. We also consider interdependencies among potential risks, and utilize the process of responding to the CDP Water Information Request annually to review and update our assessments.
Substantive change to our business as it relates to water risk is based upon our assessment of water risks at our global data centers and offices, inclusive of our direct operations only (not including our supply chain). Substantive change would be one that increased operational expenditure on water in excess of 1% of total annual company spend. Since total expenditure on water and wastewater combined is far less than this, we do not anticipate substantive change to occur. From an operational perspective, substantive change for facilities would include a requirement to significantly alter, close, and/or relocate the operations of a particular facility or group of facilities. Based on the results of our water risk assessment, there are no facilities that are sited in regions with identified water risk or stress that can generate a substantive change to occur. 																				
Our water risk is embodied at both the restaurant and supply chain level. Our most basic quantitative metric that indicates exposure to water risks that could generate substantive change in our restaurant operations –is currently a Composite Risk Score of 3.00 or higher in our WRI Aqueduct assessment. Although this assessment has not been completed within the supply chain, risk would be defined as events that create increased costs, disruption or shortages. In both cases it includes any damage to the reputation our reputation or brand image.Water risk is incorporated into the Company's broader risk management process. Water issues and initiatives are driven in partnership between the Sustainability, Corporate Communications, Legal, and Financial teams, and other key functions as relevant. These teams work together to identify substantive risks to our business and Company-owned operations that could potentially occur and work with our divisions and business units to mitigate the risks. Risks, including water risks, are prioritized based on a number of factors that impact our organization and could create substantive change, including but not limited to regulatory, operational and reputational. More specifically, we look at the likelihood, size, and scope of the factors and the number of business units/divisions impacted. In addition, we consider the length of the factors’ impact and assess whether the impact is a one-time occurrence or recurring in nature. We then make a determination whether or not it is more effective in both the short and long-term to modify, adjust or alter our business strategy given the risks. While we do not believe that individual instances of water risk would constitute a substantive risk on their own due to the total size, decentralized nature and our ability to source from different regions of the globe if it became necessary, the potential cumulative impact of water stress on could become substantive over the long term. Due to the uncertain nature of climate change on future water stress and availability, we cannot say with certainty the timeframe or level of impact.
Zimmer Biomet utilizes “high-purity water” or HPW in some medical device applications. HPW processed to be utilized at the point of use is the only material authorized in certain applications where the cleanliness and bio-burden of a device require strict control & validated outcomes. In this context a substantive change would be defined as potable water available to produce HPW severely restricted or not available in the volumes required to successfully execute medical device manufacturing operations.
We define substantive change from water risks, to our direct operations, to include:- sanctions corresponding to an interruption of production or cessation of activity for a short-term but finite duration; - significant, longer-term or offsite community or environmental impact requiring significant mitigation or additional long-term controls; and/or, - financially, we define a substantive change to an operation by using a cost threshold.

Varian defines ‘substantive’ on a case-by-case basis, evaluating impacts to operations, supply chain, product quality, customer satisfaction, employee health & safety, and reputation. Potential impacts may include increased capital costs or operational expenditures, disruption or delays in production. Substantive changes are measurable year over year.
Substantive change is defined as 1) an Extremely High risk ranking under the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool or Maplecroft risk software or 2) water risk with financial impacts exceeding levels established by the internal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process (scoring and ranking is reviewed and updated annually).
A substantive risk could include, but may not be limited to, a curtailment or disruption of mine production, prevention of mine expansion opportunities, increased capital expenditure and operational maintenance costs associated with development of alternate and renewable water supplies, or increased capital expenditures and increased operating costs associated with water quality programs and technologies.Please see additional information in the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K.

Pinnacle defines substantive change in their business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk using multiple variables - however, the most relevant indicator that is considered is the size of the impact to our business.  Pinnacle understands that climate change can affect crop seasons, water supply, and weather patterns which can have a substantive impact on the way that we do business.  Risk size is determined by financial impact.  As an example, risks are gauged by the dollar impact on earnings, assigned a probability and ranked by the size of the risk. A large portion of key ingredients and materials that we use in our products are highly dependent on the availability of water.  Our supply chain faces the largest risks due to changes in water availability and quantity which in turn, could result in higher costs for Pinnacle as well.  Our Procurement Leadership Team utilizes a supply chain risk management program that is designed to allow the Company to identify and manage risks inherent in its external supply chain, which includes assessing substantive changes in our business due to water risks.  Substantive changes in our supply chains are defined by overall risk and materiality to our business.Our direct operations also rely on the availability of water and our production operations could be impacted by change in weather patterns.  Because of the diversity of agricultural inputs in Pinnacle’s product portfolio, each single item does not create a significant risk and there exists generally supply alternatives. Additionally, the vast amount of Pinnacle’s operations and supply chain are located in North America with limited exposure to broad risks.

Our operating mines are located in arid or semi-arid regions. We source water from groundwater wells or pipe water over long distances, with the exception of New Afton, which sources water from Kamloops Lake. Almost all of the water used at our sites is associated with the processing of ore. We also require water for drilling and for dust control on mine haul roads, and use dust suppressants to minimize evaporative loss. All process water used at our mine sites is contained in a closed circuit, with only evaporation at tailings storage facilities or leach pads and entrainment in tailings and concentrates allowing water to leave the cycle of reuse. Our operating mines are zero discharge facilities, with no process water being released to the surrounding environment. Any impact on our ability to access water for our operations represents a risk to or business.

Although we do not use water within our manufacturing processes, we consider our company and supply chain subject to risks related to water, but do not consider the risks to be significant.  Like all companies, extreme weather events and resource shortages have the potential to interrupt our business and supply chain operations.  However, Motorola Solutions' operations generally are not located in low-lying areas subject to severe impacts from flooding.  Any disruption to our distribution channels could have a detrimental impact on our supply chain and product distribution.  Losses and interruption could be caused by water shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters, for which we predominantly are self-insured.

A possible risk would be increase to water costs and disposal rates due to high demand, especially at our facilities having higher water consumption for e-coat purposes.  Although it is difficult to say what is substantive at this time, any increases would impact on our overall business revenues and have to be absorbed.  We do not see changes in water rates changing any current operations.Business growth in the area of 2 of our Mexico facilities may further increase demand on water resources and water quality in these areas.

We are a food processor, so water risk for us means the threat of cost increase or production disruption. This cost increase or production disruption can occur in water-intensive and weather-vulnerable operations, and in the supply chain that provides our inputs. Disruption could include cut-off of municipal water supply due to maintenance or drought at our processing facilities or flooding of communities where we have facilities. In our supply chain, disruption could include weather events that result in seasonal shifts in availability or that change the timing and available quantity of harvest.  In general, we think about water risk in agriculture mainly as a potential contributor to cost, rather than as a production disruption. A total lack of availability of avocados in a particular region could occur in the future as a result of extreme weather events or drought, but usually such events affect supply without destroying it entirely. Additionally, we source avocados from very different geographies and ecosystems, so the likelihood of all of them experiencing stress at the same time is unlikely. Accordingly, we believe that the main risk driver in agriculture is exposure to cost risk.Furthermore, our water risk related to agriculture stems from (a) the water-related cost risk faced by our suppliers and (b) the water-related cost risk faced by the entire avocado sectors from which we purchase.  In other words, while we may be shielded from some risk by our growers’ practices, we must still purchase – and they can always sell – on spot markets.

Xylem does not have a corporate-wide definition for “substantive change” but since water is integrated into every component of our business, water risks are a key element of our risk management and business continuity planning. Our risks are managed by a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program that has a corporate framework consisting of five key components: (1) Risk Appetite and Strategy, (2) Governance and Organization, (3) Policies and Procedures, (4) Risk Management Process, and (5) Monitoring and Reporting. This framework directly supports the ERM Program’s objective of establishing “practical and sustainable policies, procedures and processes that help the Company manage and monitor risk effectively.” As such, the Program and its framework provide the means by which Xylem monitors and prioritizes its risks and governs its risk profile.Every Xylem site is also responsible for developing and implementing a site-specific Business Continuity Plan, including as elements Crisis Management Plans and IT Disaster Recovery Plans. Xylem's set of Business Continuity policies sets forth the specific requirements for business continuity responsibility, planning, risk assessment and business impact analysis, reporting and program maintenance. This policy requires Xylem sites to have in place a comprehensive set of business strategies and actions designed to protect safety, minimize the impact of a business interruption and facilitate return to normal operational levels. This process requires sites to evaluate change on a frequent basis and plan for situations that could have a substantive change to our business before they actually do. An analysis of water-related risks will be included in the local Business Continuity Plans for all Xylem facilities. This proactive procedure helps Xylem to mitigate the risks posed by water including increased water scarcity, regulatory uncertainty and declining water quality.

Delta Beverages does not believe that our organization is exposed to water risks because we believe that the municipal water supply is capable of providing the required quantity and quality of water for Delta's operations for the foreseeable future. The municipal water supply that feeds Delta Beverages is drawn from Lake Ontario which is one of the largest lakes in North America and the 14th largest lake in the world. That being said, Delta Beverages recognizes the importance of a reliable water supply to its continued business operations. Any disruption to the quantity of water supplied to Delta Beverages would force the organization to temporarily shut down its operations until sufficient water supply resumed. Any operational shut down due to lack of water supply would be considered to be a substantive change to our business operations. Issues with the quality of the water supplied could also temporarily shut down Delta's operations. If these water quality issues continued to persist, it may be necessary for Delta Beverages to make investments in more water treatment equipment. Such expenditure would also be considered a substantive change to our business operations.

Regeneron defines a substantive change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk to be anything that disrupts the business to meet specific levels across five Regeneron Business Impact Criteria. Regeneron considers this to be a low potential risk in the short-term, but understands that limited access to fresh water may affect our long term viability as the company continues to expand into regions with higher water-related risks. This definition only applies to our direct operations and does not include considerations to our suppliers’ water related risks.
Substantive change would typically involve impacts on an expansion of production at a specific site, or the development of expanded production at a new site. A significant change in supply/availability of raw materials could be considered  substantive.

A substantial change may be a new production line, an increase in production. Currently if there is an increase and the demand for water consumption is greater when being located in a hydrographic basin in Mexico, the amount of water is available. We do not have a high risk for this resource.
The facility defines a substantive change when more than 10% is impacted at the corporate level. The management has put in place a contingency plan to address the disruption of production by outsourcing the  affected operation. The E- Coat operation is most likely affected as it heavily relies on water as an integral aspect of the process operation. Consequently outsourcing e-coat services will increase operating expenditures and consequently impact our revenue.

For the Buena plant, a substantive change would be if the aquifer was affected and it was no longer able to be used.  We believe that this risk is extremely low.

As ModusLink’s water consumption is primarily used for human consumption and sanitation, this does not pose significant risks to interruption of production.
Water is an integral part of the paper making process that a percentage of our raw material is produced using.  A shortage of water would have a detrimental impact on these products but they could easily be replaced by film products. It would take time to review our processes, technology, etc. to convert products from paper to film based.  This could require a capital investment on our part to maintain the levels of revenue as a result.

PVH’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process identifies risks most material to the business. Risks are ranked based on likelihood and control comfort. Sourcing risk, identified as a top risk through the ERM process, includes the potential for natural disasters (e.g. floods, droughts), and volatile commodity costs, particularly in key sourcing countries. In addition to PVH’s ERM process, we undertook a water risk assessment in 2016. Per WWF’s Water Risk Filter tool, three types of risks are identified; physical risk, reputational risk, and regulatory risk. Physical risk is defined as water quantity (e.g. scarcity, flooding, droughts) and quality (pollution) within the river basin and the impacts this might have on society and the environment. Regulatory risk is defined as the strength and enforcement of water regulations and the consequences of restrictions by public institutions; either felt through direct regulatory action or from neglect, blockages, or failure. Reputational risk is defined as perceptions around water use, pollution, and behavior that may have negative impacts on the company brand and influence purchasing decisions. Public perceptions can emerge rapidly when local aquatic systems and community access to water are affected. Substantive change is defined as changes in availability, continuity, price, quality, delivery time and reliability of the supply base or the public opinion that impacts sourcing performance, sourcing strategy and/or the company reputation.

While water sources are abundant in the DRC and investigations to date indicate that there are multiple potential sources of water supply for the Kipushi and Kamoa-Kakula project. Both projects have continual risk of flooding of the underground infrastructure. Risk management strategies include primary dewatering systems as well as backup systems in case of failure.   The Platreef Project is located in a scarce water area. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to secure sufficient sources and quantities of water, particularly at the Platreef Project, where the Company will need to secure an interest in or water access rights from forthcoming water development projects. The means of such access includes securing the commercial entitlement to the water source, developing the infrastructure to transport it to the Platreef Project and obtaining necessary government and regulatory permits. In addition, in South Africa, where the Platreef Project is located, the National Water Authority imposed a new regime on the use of water resources and requires an integrated water use licence for all water uses. All mining operations require an integrated water use licence for all new water uses and a detailed study of the water balance in the area must precede an application for a licence.
Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials due to water risk may have an adverse impact on profitability. Flowers Foods identifies manufacturing sites that could potentially contribute to substantial change due to water risks as those that meet the following criteria:1) Sites with a) ”High” or “Extremely High” Baseline water stress and b) Projected Annual Renewable Water Supply in 2025 of less than 500 m^3 or 500-1000 m^3 per person (WBCSD Global Water Tool)AND/OR2) A risk score of 3 or higher for "Overall External Risk Rating" for BOTH current and projected risks (WRI Aqueduct)AND3) Account for more than 2% of Flowers Foods' total production volume in 2016.
Substantive change in both our business operations and supply chain would include a reduced level of operations at any single facility such that the individual facility would not be capable of supplying the entire quantity of production needed to meet global commercial demand for that product. Potential negative impacts could include experiencing a reduction in revenues and inability to service therapeutic/medical market demands for the affected product. This substantive change could also negatively impact AbbVie's Research and Development operations and supply chain through a reduction in that organization's ability to promote discovery, development and clinical investigations in new therapeutic areas.

Birla Carbon’s production process has generally not changed over a number of years.  Where technological innovations are available we have made process changes to ensure maximum water efficiency utilization.  Through water retention and recycling programs and other conservation measures we do not anticipate substantive changes in our water risks unless there is some significant unforeseen circumstance in a specific geographic location where water resource might become unavailable or substantially increased in cost.  Poor water quality and potential flooding is possible in some of our locations and we have integrated those risks into our Enterprise Risk Management approach.
As an organization, we define a substantive change as one that has a material impact on our business with our determination guided by the definition of materiality under SEC rules and interpretations.

We use the WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool to assess potential substantive changes in our business and operations due to water stress.  HP defines substantive change from water risk in our operations as facilities that are downgraded to either scarce or extremely scarce renewable water supply per person as defined by the WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool.  Our threshold is when a facility moves from sufficient water supply to stressed status.  This applies to all of our operations globally.  We also apply similar methodology to our supply chain.    Based on 2016 facility water risk assessment, we have approximately 33 sites where water risk is high and 90 sites where water risk is ranked medium to high risk.  Many of these sites have been considered water scarce for years and have become our best practice sites for water conservation. As Hewlett Packard Company, we achieved our 2020 goal to reduce freshwater consumption per employee 20% compared to 2010. As HP Inc., we set a new goal to reduce potable water consumption by 15% by 2025 compared to 2015. Through 2016, potable water consumption at HP sites globally decreased by 3% compared to 2015.  Taking into account the separation of Hewlett-Packard Company on November 1, 2015, calculation for all years relates to supply chain, operations, and products and solutions associated with the business units that are now a part of HP Inc.

We use the WBCSD Global Water tool to assess potential substantive changes in our business and operations due to water stress.  HPE defines substantive change from water risk in our operations as facilities that are downgraded to either scarce or extremely scarce renewable water supply per person as defined by the WBSCD Global Water tool.  Our measurement is based on the total renewable water resource per person at a site, as defined by the Water Tool.  Our threshold is when a facility moves from sufficient water supply to stressed.  This applies to all of our operations globally.  We also apply similar methodology to our supply chain.  Based on 2016 facility data, we identified 62 sites that we considered to have scarce or extremely scarce renewable water supply per person. Many of these sites have been considered water scarce for years and have become our best practice sites for water conservation. The majority of these sites are small sites with minimal employee populations and limited potential impact to our company wide operations.

Dell's largest water risk is associated with supply chain disruption caused by climate change and other water hazards. These disruptions could cause loss in revenue from loss of availability and increase in operations costs as alternative suppliers are utilized at greater costs. Much of Dell's water consumption is based around municipal use, so we have historically prioritized focus on water consumption in water stressed regions.
