A substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risks is defined as an unplanned disruption of the potable water supply and/or degradation of water quality of 1 hour or longer, which may be substantial enough to warrant shutting down portions of our manufacturing processes. As our manufacturing process is highly regimented, delays at any stage due to a water shortage has the potential to require the entire batch to be discarded for quality and safety concerns. Additionally, some of our suppliers are under similar constraints and substantial shutdowns for them could impact our material supplies, thus restricting our operations.

We follow an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process that encompasses our entire company to identify, assess, prioritize and address major risks on an ongoing basis.  ERM addresses the full spectrum of risks: market/environmental, compliance, legal, strategic, financial/operational and reputational.  When a significant risk is identified, the process includes the development, implementation and monitoring of risk mitigation strategies and reporting. Within ERM, we define Business Continuity Management as a holistic management process that identifies lower-probability significant events, including those resulting from climate change-related events such as the increased frequency or severity of weather conditions, including hurricanes, typhoons or tornados.The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors participates in regular reviews of our ERM process to assess and manage enterprise risks, including those related to market/environmental, strategic, financial, operational, legal, compliance and reputational risks. As appropriate, these risks would include water risks.  In addition, each of the other standing Board Committees regularly meet to discuss the short-term and long-term objectives and provide oversight for risks related to the applicable committee’s areas of responsibility.  As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight as part of its fiduciary duty of care to effectively monitor business operations. Our Board administers its risk oversight function as a whole and through its Committees.  The asset or operational responsibility for these areas is delegated to the senior executive level.
Brown-Forman evaluates many variables in determining substantive change of our business and operations. One such variable is the overall availability of water for use in our direct operations. Globally, our company faces some direct risk associated with water scarcity because of the location of our operations and the requirements for water in our production processes and finished products. This risk stems from constraints on the available quantity, quality, and cost of water supplies across our enterprise but especially from a minority of our operations located in certain sensitive areas.Furthermore, a number of our key ingredients are agricultural based and are also dependent upon the availability of water. Any change in water dynamics, including water stress or even flooding, could cause supply disruptions or alterations in our supplier arrangements. This would result in cost increases for Brown-Forman. Also within our supply chain, we utilize co-packers for final completion of products. These facilities, while outside our operational control, rely upon abundant amounts of high quality water to carry out their services. Any disruption to their operations could impact the production and delivery of products.Weather, the effects of climate change, diseases, and other agricultural uncertainties that affect the mortality, health, yield, quality, or price of the various raw materials used in our products also present risks for our business, including in some cases potential impairment in the recorded value of our inventory. Changes in weather patterns or intensity can substantively disrupt our supply chain as well, which may affect production operations, insurance costs and coverage, as well as the timely delivery of our products to customers.Water is one of the major components of our products, so the quality and quantity of available water is important to our ability to operate our business. If droughts become more common or severe, or if our water supply were interrupted for other reasons, high-quality water could become scarce in some key production regions for our products, including Tennessee, Kentucky, California, Canada, and Mexico.

While Bunge has not defined a numerical threshold for what constitutes a substantive risk related to water, material impacts to the company’s financial results may stem from three types of risk:Our sugar production depends on the volume and sucrose content of the sugarcane that we cultivate or that is supplied to us by third-party growers. Both sugarcane crop yields and sucrose content depend significantly on weather conditions, such as rainfall and prevailing temperatures.  As such, unfavorable weather conditions have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our sugar operations.Adverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, reduce demand for our fertilizer products and negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us.Severe adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or flooding, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries and other loss and damage to us. Our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services. A disruption in transportation services, as a result of weather conditions or otherwise, may also significantly adversely impact our operations.
We realize that water risks could cause a substantive change in our business.  First, our operations could be affected if we had to shut down our manufacturing facilities due to a lack of water.  This would significantly impact our revenues.  Next, if water related risks impact our suppliers, we could either be impacted by not being able to obtain enough ingredients to make our products or have to pay a higher price for them.  At the end of the day, both of these things would have a negative impact on our revenues.
A substantive change in Carnival's business as it would relate to water risk would be an increase in expenditures or a massive change in ragulations that would significantly reduce net profits.
Sites are not located in water scarcity areas - our usage is broadly flat in terms of performance, and local municipal suppliers provide us updates and forecast as to supply integrity
One of our operations in British Columbia is exposed if there is a drought situation that limits our ability to use water for the manufacture of our paper products.  Climate change has impacted the region and we are experience wide variations in winter snow pack and wide variations in summer precipitation.

We define substantive change by risks to water that materially impact our business, operations, revenue or expenditure in a negative way for a significant period of time that would prevent us from carrying on normal operations and manufacturing activities to make and ship our products to customers. A substantive scenario could lead to reduced business in the mid-term, reduction in revenue, and increase expenditures to cope with realized risk time periods.
Potential substantive changes to Celgene’s business and operations from water risks (see complete list below) are related to those that can contribute to a change in our business operations and impact costs related to water resources (withdrawal and discharge) and meeting regulatory requirements. This can also include any change or risk in water availability or quality utilized at our facility for operational use or employee consumption. This definition for substantive change is only applied to Celgene’s direct operations; another definition that relates to Celgene’s supply chain has yet to be formulated and applied.

Cisco defines substantive change as either affecting publicly reported financial results, changes to existing enterprise risk assessment results requiring mitigating action, or impacting component or product availability to the extent customer shipments or schedule are impacted. Cisco quantifies substantive change as having an impact on revenue greater than $0.5B USD or having an impact on operational costs greater than $200M USD. This definition applies to both our direct operations and supply chain and is reviewed and updated on an annual basis as part of Cisco's broader enterprise risk management (ERM) process conducted by Cisco's internal audit organization.

Clorox has enterprise risk management processes to identify, assess and prioritize business risks. Clorox uses a systematic process to evaluate risks. The process includes identifying risks, assessing exposures and quantifying the value at risk to the company. The evaluation considers level of potential impact, the overall vulnerability to an event based on the time and our capacity to react and adapt, and the likelihood of an occurrence.While severe regional weather events have the potential to disrupt our operations, or that of our customers and/or suppliers, we believe our dispersed supply chain affords us redundancy, which mitigates risk to our business from localized events. Additionally, Clorox engages in engineering loss-prevention strategies aimed at reducing the risk of natural and accidental hazards and each location has backup power supply for critical functions. The company’s manufacturing locations have comprehensive emergency response plans and most locations have business continuity plans. The company’s headquarters also has an emergency response plan with trained floor wardens, established evacuation procedures and business continuity plans for critical functions. We believe the location of our facilities limit threats from rising ocean levels.
Consumers Energy defines a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure for water risk as any change that would dramatically affect our operation reliability, costs or reputation.  The definition applies to direct operations. Specific levels of change or numeric metrics of change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure for water are not established.  Electricity markets are complex and based on many factors, including the relative cost of electricity within an established organization, often covering several states.  The organization is approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to coordinate, control and monitor the use of the electric transmission system by utilities, generators and marketers. For the operations and facilities covered in this response, that organization is the Mid-Continent Independent System Operator (MISO), Zone 7.
While we have completed individual water risk assessments at the facility level, we cannot determine at this time if they will have a substantive change in our business operations, revenue or expenditures.
Colgate uses an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program to identify, assess, prioritize and manage physical risks. The ERM Committee is sponsored by the Chairman, President and CEO of the Company and includes representation from key internal business leaders.  Risks are collectively identified across the organization and are classified within the Strategic, Financial, Operational, Information Technology, Legal & Compliance and Emerging Risk Categories.  Each Risk Category is assigned an owner who is also a member of the ERM Committee and who is ultimately accountable for successfully managing the identified risk.  The Natural Disaster ERM - addresses the physical risks associated with water and climate change that could disrupt our commercial and supply chain operations.   Colgate also has a formal process to identify critical suppliers (e.g. high volume suppliers, suppliers of critical materials, non-substitutable formulas). Every year we update our segmentation strategies where we classify materials and suppliers according to the criticality of the material segment as well as the market complexity and buyer power using a matrix tool. Selected agricultural materials that are impacted by change in precipitation extremes and droughts are considered in this process. Risk management plans including changes in source of supply and potential alternative formulations are in place.For purposes of this survey, we used a screening criteria to identify sites meeting the CDP guidance for "substantive" as follows: 1) sites indicated as "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk per WRI Aqueduct, and 2) which are either considered strategic sites or those which account for >2% of global production volume.This threshold is evaluated annually, when the Aqueduct tool is used to evaluate water risk. The Global Sustainability and EHS group engages with local sites to evaluate the threshold based on both the Aqueduct tool and more short-term and local conditions and events.

Water-related risks are particularly relevant to the food industry, with a global supply chain intensely dependent on the availability of clean water to grow ingredients. Managing water risk — both at our own facilities and those embedded in our supply chain — is critical to Conagra Brands’ long-term business success. To determine whether these water-related risks have potential to generate a substantive change in our business operations, revenue or expenditures, we've applied US Securities Exchange Commission materiality principles, considering both quantitative and qualitative impacts.  The risk analysis factors in both the probability of the risk and estimated financial implications.  For this purpose, material risks generating substantive change to our direct operations and supply chain would be changes affecting more than 5% of our revenue or assets.

In defining substantive change to our business, operations, revenues or expenditures from water risk, Constellation considers both the magnitude of the potential loss, and the likelihood of the risk. For the purposes of this report, we define substantive change as the potential loss of 5% or more of our global production volume as well as the potential loss of 5% in each segment of our business (beer vs. wine & spirits). This percentage may vary slightly year to year. This metric includes only our direct Operations and not our supply chain.
We define substantive site-level water risks as any facility (direct operation) meeting all of the following criteria:(1) Site is identified as being High or Extremely High risk utilizing our ensemble risk tool methodology;(2) Site accounts for >5% of our global production by volume; and(3) Site is considered strategic to the growth strategy of the organization.Sites are evaluated against these criteria annually to determine if they meet this definition, indicating a substantive change
Anything that significantly effects CPG's production would be considered a substantive change to our business, operations, revenue and expenditure.
Cummins uses a multi-pronged approach to evaluate risks and opportunities and determining if they are substantive to our business. Cummins Business Continuity Planning function prioritizes and addresses key risks of which water related issues are one component. Cummins developed a cause and effect (C&E) matrix to prioritize sites combining multiple factors including: 1) site’s self-assessment of water risk from a survey on source water sustainability, quality, discharge, regulatory, and cost considerations addressing both current and future conditions, 2) site size and complexity, 3) the presence or absence of water supply assessments, 4) and watershed-specific water stress indicators.  For water stress indicators, Cummins worked with an external consultant to develop a composite picture of current and future water stress by combining data from WRI Aqueduct Tool, WBCSD Global Water Tool, and consultant expertise in the countries/regions where we operate. Portions of this data extend to a 2025 planning horizon.  Scoring and weighting factors were applied to each of the 4 components of the C&E matrix and an ‘at risk’ threshold was defined as any sites scoring 150 or above in total composite score. Based on this, Cummins conducted detailed watershed assessments at each of the 3 locations scoring above the 150 ‘at risk’ threshold, recently we added two more sites.  BFCEC due to its growth that raised the risk scoring and CBL due to specific water issues arising in the area. In addition to the watershed assessments over 24 site level audits have been conducted to further validate conditions at prioritized sites.  These audits and assessments identified specific areas for water management improvements including conservation, risk management, and community/watershed engagement opportunities.Facility data and conditions are reviewed annually and may alter the priority sites from year to year. In addition to the six sigma project, CMI has developed a risk scoring tool that utilizes real time risk and quality data available from Maplecroft.  This new tool can be used at any time and will assign a risk factor for each site that can be used when evaluating investment opportunities. It will also help in the evaluation of a supplier and new facility locations.

To generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenues, or expenditures, any particular event or change would have to impact either a wide range of product lines or a large swath of our stores. Because of the wide geographical diversity and the many diverse product lines that we sell, an impact on any one store or product line would not substantively impact the company as a whole.

As stated in our 2016 fiscal year 10-K, John Deere's business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment.  This may include water related items such as timing and quantity of rainfall, excessive rain, flooding and drought conditions. Due to the variability and uncertainty of weather conditions affecting our customers globally, for the purposes of this CDP response we are focused on our direct operations, and the water risk attributes of water scarcity and volume. Using the WRI Aqueduct Tool, we define substantive change from water risk in terms of water scarcity and volume for those manufacturing and distribution operations currently sited in regions defined as having a baseline water stress of extremely high stress, high stress, and medium to high stress considering a projected change over 20 years. We also determine if these sites are considered strategic meaning they account for >2% of global production volume. If both criteria are met, then these sites could pose a substantive change in our business, operations or revenue.

Our process for defining and identifying substantive changes is the same process used to establish Strategic Growth Plans (SGPs), annual objectives, and monthly/quarterly priorities. At the enterprise level, we also utilize a risk assessment process to identify and track significant business risks.We develop strategic plans and associated initiatives based on annual input from business unit leaders, market research and analysis, as well as external and functional expertise. At the enterprise level, a strategic framework provides direction for refining business unit strategies. In developing our strategic objectives, we endeavor to identify any opportunities or risks (financial, regulatory, capability, etc.) that would improve or impede our ability to achieve our objectives.Further, the capital budgeting process includes criteria for sustainability and water related risks and opportunities.
From an operational perspective, substantive change to our business from water risk would be defined according to disrupted operations or lost  production due to the unavailability of water. Devon has been effective in its proactive evaluation of risks and opportunities to ensure continuing operations.
The impact of environmental regulations is considered during Diebold Nixdorf's combined annual sustainability and risk assessment. Regulatory impacts to our business are considered from a cost of compliance, reputation impacts, loss of business, and the potential for financial penalties. Environmental impacts due to pollution and other environmental conditions is rated on a risk impact scale. Regional and Country officers, numbering more than 150, of the Global Sustainability and Social Responsibility team coordinate and review risks and opportunities related to climate change at the facility level. The results of the integrated annual Risk Assessment are reported to the Diebold Nixdorf Executive Leadership Team, and the Advisory Council.
As stated in our annual 10-K filing, weather, climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business.We may be faced with water availability risks. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. Climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate, and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.

The majority of our operations and supply chain takes place in Michigan, which has an abundant fresh water supply.  Although the risks to our company are low at this time, the risks are expected to increase in the future (e.g. as regulations continue to change and challenge our industry).  An example of a substantive change would be legislation or a physical change in supply that would reduce our ability to withdraw the amount of water needed to produce adequate amount of electricity for our customers.
DuPont defines substantive change in terms of the SEC definition for materiality. What constitutes “material” must be judged from the viewpoint of a reasonably prudent investor making a decision to buy, hold or sell stock. An item is considered material, if in the light of surrounding circumstances, the magnitude of the item is such that it is probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the item. DuPont does not believe it has any material water risks.  In item 1A of our annual 10-K, we do identify unpredictable seasonal and weather factors as a risk that could impact sales and earnings from the company’s Agriculture segment.  Weather factors such as droughts or changing precipitation patterns could impact the agriculture sector in several ways.  Please refer to Item 1A of our annual 10-K report for a discussion of risk factors.  It can be found here: www.investors.dupont.com.

We employ a multifaceted process to determine our company’s material issues in order to align materiality with our company and customers’ key business drivers. Ecolab’s annual enterprise “Assessment of Significant Business Risks” provides the foundation for assessing the materiality of issues to our business. The annual assessment is conducted using a survey tool designed to identify strategic, operational, financial and compliance-related risks to the company. Risks are documented along with the likelihood and impact of their occurrence. An audit-services vice president manages the process, and the results are presented to the executive committee and Ecolab board of directors. The most significant, and therefore substantive business risks are reported publicly through the company’s annual 10-K filing.Using the Assessment of Significant Business Risks as a foundation, we undertook a rigorous process to analyze risks and opportunities specific to sustainability in 2013 and revisit this work bi-annualy. We embarked on a strategic approach to better understand and measure against the issues that present material risks and opportunities to our company as they align with the interests of our stakeholders (primarily customers) but we also engage a diverse set of stakeholders to assess the materiality of sustainability-specific issues including employees, customers, investors and relevant external groups.Substantive change to our business as it relates to water risk is based upon an assessment of water risks at our direct manufacturing operations related to our production volume where it can effect greater than 10% of our direction operations and facilities by production. This definition does not yet apply to our supply chain. This assessment and its criteria are reviewed annually and incorporated into our annual business risk assessment and reporting processes.

We define a substantive change as any water-related impact that results in material reduction or stoppage in production and/or revenue at our sites, or a large change in expenditures relating to water sourcing, treatment and management.
In our business, bulk active ingredient manufacturing sites use the largest amounts of water followed by final dosage finishing sites. Packaging sites require very little water and present less risk to the organization. In our Global Supply Chain, we already take into account manufacturing issues that could shut down bulk active ingredient sites for 6 to 10 months, drug final dosage finishing manufacturing for 2 to 3 months and packaging for 1 to 2 months.  We use inventory management practices as a primary risk mitigation strategy. An extreme water stress event (i.e. a drought that provided a moratorium on water use for many months) would have to extend beyond these periods for there to be a potential economic impact on Lilly. Our Global Supply Chain area also works with our Treasury area and an external consultant to develop scenarios of "catastrophic" events (i.e. a manufacturing site being "destroyed"). We determined that a drought/water disruption scenario would have to extend for a long period of time (i.e,. several years) to cause a substantive change to our business. Given these conditions and our product mix, we made a determination that extended periods of drought should not significantly impact our business. Costs associated with these analyses are embedded in operating budgets and are not disclosed.
The Enbridge Liquid Pipelines business unit defines risk to water as having a substantive change to our business using a standardized risk matrix to evaluate risk consequence and likelihood.  Where Enbridge’s operations could impact water the risk consequence is considered to be Major to Critical; however the likelihood of events occurring at these locations is kept Low through multiple control and mitigation measures.  The risk consequence of an impact to water range defined as Major to Critical ranges in financial value from >$1M to ≤$1B, impacts an area ranging in size from 0.1 ha to 1 km2 and impacts a waterbody ranging from a wetland to a lake or fast moving creek or river.  Ecological restoration activities could range from 1 to 10 years in duration.   Project risks around water which could contribute to substantive changes to business are assessed through the use of a Risk Screening Tool.  Risk levels are classified as Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High with a set of detailed impact criteria associated to each level.  Risks associated with leaks and spills to water from a stakeholder materiality perspective are considered to have a Very High Impact and Very High Probability.  The Impact Criteria include costs in excess of $50M, a delay in milestone achievements (i.e. project completion) of greater than 6 months and a service disruption of greater than 1 month for our customers.A risk consequence of Major to Critical would be considered to be a substantive change to our business.
Substantive change is defined as impacting the economic viability of an operational area or facility, triggering a new evaluation of whether the facility is a net asset or liability.  For instance, if the cash flows no longer exceed the anticipated abandonment or the cumulative positives are less than the book value (up front capital), there may be net loss.Metrics used to determine substantive change include: proved reserves, annual production, net income, cashflow, fixed and variable operational costs, finding and development costs and capital efficiencies.  These metrics are reviewed annually.  Due to variable economic parameters, specific thresholds used to determine substantiveness vary by operational area. Enerplus defines substantive applicable to direct operation only.
A substantive change from water risk would include impacts to operations or expenditures due to water availability or cost that would drive financial performance results for the year significantly outside the forecasted ranges (i.e. guidance).
Substantive change would be one that significantly impacts operations or has a material financial impact such as a cooling water system retrofit, if mandated by the permitting authority, or it could also be the potential for shareholder or customer concern, or a combination resulting in a larger impact. The basis for expressing the percentage of operation affected is based on plants identified using WRI AqueDuct risk mapping plus our own plant specific information. The calculation is: total net generation MWh of the facilities located in water stress regions divided by the total net generation MWh produced by the generation facilities over which Exelon has operational control.  This percentage does not include operations related to the marketing and distribution of energy or natural gas, which have less significant water uses. Exelon Corporation compiles an enterprise-wide inventory of water withdrawals and associated discharges annually. Exelon used the WRI AqueDuct to screen for potential geographic water scarcity. All facilities identified in the screening process as being potentially located in water scarce areas were further evaluated using internal company knowledge and regional basin management information to confirm the model output.  The WRI AqueDuct uses twelve global maps grouped into physical, quantity, quality, and regulatory and reputational risk. The seven physical quantity risks include: baseline water stress; inter-annual variability; seasonal variability; floods; drought severity; upstream storage and groundwater. Physical water quality risks include return flow ratio and upstream protected land. The three regulatory and reputational risks include media coverage, access to water and threatened amphibians. Overall water risk assessment identifies areas with higher exposure to these water-related risks and is an aggregated measure. In the past Exelon used the UNEP water stress map: http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/jpg/0221-waterstress-EN.jpg which shows that Exelon has no operations in water stressed areas based on the UNEP definition (less than 1700 cubic meters per person per year). WRI’s new AqueDuct assessment tool is far broader in its definition of water stress, and therefore identifies some areas where we operate that are subject to water stress as defined in the multivariate analyses in the WRI AqueDuct tool.

As a large logistics company with many sites spread throughout the globe, we are relatively well protected from site specific changes and/or disruptions. To protect from these risks, we haveaddressed business interruption and contingency planning at several levels within our organization (facilities, data processing, and operations). We have a business continuity plan and crisis management teams to manage the critical products and services we provide for our customers. With these teams, we have the ability to immediately respond to any potential risk to our business operations. If a facility were to experience a major event, Expeditors has a disaster recovery site and redundant data center located in a geographically different location from our corporate headquarters which would allow us to resume operations within this facility should the need arise within our global network. We assess and mitigate risk surrounding disaster recovery of our systems through systems health monitoring, forecasting and diagnostics.
Water is essential to FirstEnergy's ability to generate electricity, as many of our plants use water for steam production and plant cooling purposes.  Costs could be incurred in the future due to more stringent water regulations and/or availability of sufficient quantity and quality of freshwater.
Natural disasters such as floods and disruptions to our utility water supply that affect a plant's ability to produce and perform process development activities are water risks that could generate substantive change to our business. These risks would likely result in us losing some production for a while, until we are able to bring the affected buildings back to production. Substantive risk is defined in terms of its impact on our overall production. Of the 3.1GW produced in 2016, our manufacturing facility in Ohio represented approximately 17% while operations in Malaysia represent 83%. In addition to manufacturing thin film solar photovoltaic modules, First Solar also develops, finances, engineers, constructs, and operates some of the world’s largest PV power plants. The successful development and construction of solar energy generation facilities is contingent upon, securing necessary water rights for project construction and operation, among other things. Water shortages in regions where we develop and construct PV projects could adversely affect, delay and/or render the successful completion of a particular project infeasible.

The risk to our operations is strictly due to interruption or curtailment, as opposed to the cost of water. Although most of our business processes do not consume large quantities of water, we do require sufficient supply in order to run our business. If our operations were to experience an event where we could not receive ample water, in the form of interruption, we would face significant limits to production. During our risk assessment, we concluded that the facilities that consume the largest percentage of water are not in water stressed regions. The ability to source water in a reliable fashion impacts both our direct operations, and our supply chain, because both rely on water in order to function.
We use an industry definition.

Our analysis of Ford operations shows that some of our facilities are located in regions where water supplies are already scarce. Global climate change also has the potential to further impact the quality and availability of water. We cannot be certain that we will always have access to water of the quantity and quality that our operations require. Our water strategy puts primary emphasis on our plants located in areas of water scarcity. Ford is committed to conserving water and using it responsibly. We will address water challenges internally within our own operations and externally in communities where we operate and throughout our supply chain. We have committed to measureable actions to support our global water strategy. In deciding which facilities and which basins concern Ford, aggregate scores from the Global Water Tool (subwatershed level) were used alongside internal knowledge of specific facilities and local watersheds. If a facility had a high risk or projected risk by the tools, it was listed. The operating facilities listed as “substantive” had to have a high stress or risk and have a production or support production of greater than 1% of global relevant production (vehicle, engines, or transmissions). This definition of risk applies to Ford’s direct operations.  For supply chain, we utilized a different methodology to determine water risks that could generate a potential impact to our supply chain. Suppliers are selected to participate in the CDP Supply Chain water questionnaire based on a combination of factors including those that supply water-intensive commodities, those with operations in water-stressed areas (as determined using the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and Maplecroft tool), and the business relationship to Ford. We repeat our assessment of selected suppliers in light of developments in these three areas on an annual basis. The ongoing data obtained through the CDP surveys has helped us identify “hotspots” for GHG emissions and water use. These suppliers have been targeted to participate in the Partnership for a Cleaner Environment (PACE) program whereby Ford will share leading practices for water use reductions with these suppliers to reduce our collective environmental footprint.
Substantive changes from water risks in our supply chain include those that could have a substantial impact on our business results or reputation with key stakeholders. These could include disruptions in our ability to source products or increases in product costs due to risks such as water scarcity, quality, pollution, drought or flooding. They could also include reputation risks due to the impact of water-related risks that affect the well-being of the people who make our clothes or local communities. These reputation risks could adversely affect consumers' perceptions of our brands and lead to lower demand for our products.
We perform an ongoing assessment of a variety of risks impacting our business.  As part of that process, we consider potential financial impacts over the near term and longer time horizons.  Our risk analysis includes potential costs associated with increased or volatile commodity prices (and other related costs) resulting from water risks as well as risk of water supply restrictions to facilities.  Risks are evaluated based on the total financial impact relative to the size of our business and the likelihood of those risks coming to fruition.
For direct operations, GM defines substantive change in their business to be when more than 20% of operating production could be impacted at a company level for ongoing operations (for example an impact to 2 million vehicles of production). The Chief Risk Officer of GM is Mary Barra, also Chairman and CEO. The Risk Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing GM’s management of enterprise-level risks.    Additionally, during new construction planning, the site planning team considers substantive risk as inadequate water supply for direct operations to meet 100% design operating production volumes.While the risks related to water at any individual GM facility are not substantive to GM in total, our operations in Mexico at San Luis Potosi, Silao, and Ramos Arizpe were identified as substantive during the site planning phase and corrective actions to mitigate the water risks were implemented prior to production start.  This includes additional spending for water reuse to meet production water supply requirements, even at the extreme level of Zero Liquid Discharge at one facility, to minimize the impact to GM's operations and the local community. For supply chain operations, GM has performed life cycle analysis of water consumption of all suppliers and used water consumption information to identify the top 100 suppliers by overall risk using WRI Aqueduct model.  Although 4% showed high risk, our experience with current operations show that there is not a substantive risk due to water for these suppliers. To engage these high risk and other strategic suppliers, GM joined CDP Water supply chain in 2014, continuing in 2015-6 and invited all of our strategic suppliers, including the high risk suppliers to engage them in water risk management.

The unavailability of clean water will directly impact our ability to produce our products and sanitize our facilities.  We would either have to bring in water to overcome temporary interruptions in supply or relocate operations.
Substantive changes include a decrease or stoppage of production, or a significant increase in expenditures from water risk that is expected long term.
In the context of the CDP Water response, Goodyear interprets a substantive change as the inability to manufacture tires in accordance with Goodyear's long-term strategy. This relates to direct operations and the measure would include the prevention of growing production by one tire or more, meaning any growth prevented directly by water-related issues. This metric is reviewed annually as a part of the global water risk assessment and is included in the overall water risk assessment plans.

Substantive risks to our direct operations are those that impact our ability to successfully deliver products to our customers in a timely manner. Risks are prioritized based on severity and probability, allowing us to focus on those risks that are the most likely to have a considerable financial impact.Our production facilities monitor and report potential site-specific risks monthly, and company-wide assessments are completed annually. Each assessment follows a standard methodology that evaluates the frequency and severity of potential risks, including several climate related risks, such as sea level rise and flooding. These scores are ranked based on a scale of likelihood and severity, and the top potential risks make up management priorities for the upcoming period. Additionally, we work closely with our customers to understand their concerns and meet all risk mitigation requirements, including coordinating customer audits of relevant facilities.
Substantive change is defined as change that could materially impact revenues or costs. For example by curtailing operations such as hydraulic fracturing, or by restricting access to a crucial supply chain input such as fresh water or guar.
A substantive change is defined by Caesars as any risk that may impose one or more of the following: 1) physical damage, 2) increased regulatory constraints, or 3) impacts to operations, services, and revenues. The following thresholds have been identified for each type of substantive change: 1) a repair or replacement costing Caesars more than $25k -- the threshold for capital funds approval 2) any regulatory constraints that prohibit the use of our swimming pools, golf courses or impact the availability of water to provide fully-functioning WASH services, 3) an interruption in utility service, or one day of lost revenue at any Caesars property. This definition is inclusive of indirect impacts to operations, services and revenue through the supply chain. If a reduction in supply impacts menus for more than 5 business days, this would be considered substantive. If suppliers and alternative suppliers increase the cost of their goods or services by 8%, this would be considered substantive. Any amount of negative media attention would be considered substantive, as negative media attention will negatively affect the Caesars brand. We assess sites and supply chain categories at risk every year and determine which of these thresholds maybe in peril according to the WRI aqueduct tool and each sites water use. Additionally groups throughout the organization review each threshold on a regular basis as part of their responsibilities.
For CDP, Hilton defines substantive water risk as the exposure of Hilton’s owned or managed hotels to risks which may potentially impact the hotel’s ability to operate or provide required fresh water required for employees and guest service in the future.  While the overall WWF risk assessment is conducted on all hotels globally, the definition of substantive risk applies to owned and managed hotel assets where Hilton has a greater financial interest.  The substantive risk metric or indicator used is the WWF Average Basin Risk, which defines high-risk facilities as those with a final basin-related risk score of 4.0 or greater.  Related high-risk indicators for the individual facilities are also evaluated (scarcity, drought, flooding, pollution, regulatory, etc.) to identify key drivers and challenges to be addressed through property operations and Hilton’s Water Stewardship initiatives.  Hotels with a WWF final basin-related risk score of 3.50-3.99 are typically defined as moderate risk, and thus not included in Hilton’s responses for W3 and W5.  However, these hotels are screened in greater detail and we consider hotels within the same river basin with moderate to high water risk as “substantive risk” for reporting purposes at the basin level (i.e., Yangtze River, China).To clarify, hotels collectively ranked as high-risk do not represent a substantive impact to Hilton’s overall global business, operations, revenue or expenditure. Out of the total 4600 hotels evaluated, a total of 242 hotels (5%) had a basin risk score of 3.5 or greater.  For owned and managed only, a total of 124 hotels had a basin risk score of 3.5 or greater (approximately 2.5% of the global portfolio/revenues or 17% of the owned and managed portfolio).  Out of these 124 hotels, 21 hotels in China, Egypt and India had a basin risk score of 4.0 or greater (less than 1% of the global portfolio or 3% of the owned and managed portfolio).  While minimal impact, this approach helps us better understand challenges in specific areas in order to identify potential opportunities for Hilton’s water stewardship initiatives. Of the 218 hotels with a basin risk between 3.50-3.99, over 50% are franchised properties. The vast majority (106/115) of these franchised hotels are located in Mexico and U.S. regions that have experienced severe drought in recent years (California, Texas, Nevada, New Mexico).
Hudbay Minerals identifies substantive change as a significant impact on the economics of a project or operation that would result in a substantial additional capital investment or a significant deterioration in the financial return on an existing investment.
Husky's enterprise risk management program supports decision-making via comprehensive and systematic identification and assessment of risks that could materially impact the results of the Company. Through this framework, the Company builds risk management and mitigation into strategic planning and operational processes for its business units through the adoption of standards and best practices. Husky has developed an enterprise risk matrix to identify risks to its people, the environment, its assets and its reputation, and to systematically mitigate these risks to an acceptable level. Husky defines substantive change as having a financial impact of greater than ten (10) million dollars.The corporate risk register is revisited on at least an annual basis, while the matrix is evaluated every three years.
Based on the nature and scope of our business operations and our interaction with suppliers, IBM does not perceive any unusual water-related risks in our operations or the supply chain outside of those we plan for as part of our ongoing business and risk management processes. These risk management processes look at business risk comprehensively including, but not limited to, risks and impacts related to water use and discharge. We anticipate that the business models of both IBM’s and our production and service suppliers’ operations will enable those operations to anticipate and adapt to potential risks and mitigate the impacts without significant disruptions to our business. This risk management approach is primarily achieved through implementation of the IBM global Environmental Management System, established for over 40 years, which is integrated into our business operations.

Intel’s Board of Directors and management consider “risk” for these purposes to be the possibility that an undesired event could occur that might adversely affect the achievement of our objectives. The types of risks that Intel faces include:• Macro-economic risks such as inflation, reductions in economic growth, or recession• Political risks such as restrictions on access to markets, confiscatory taxation, and expropriation of assets• Physical risks such as natural disasters (e.g., floods, prolonged drought, etc.)• Business-specific risks related to strategic position, operational execution, financial structure, legal and regulatory compliance, corporate governance, and environmental stewardship• Reputational risks, such as the community's perception of how we manage our water, particularly in times of prolonged drought• Regulatory risks, such as changing regulations that could limit the amount of water used or increase our costs related to water usageWe define a "substantive change" related to water-risk as a change that would impact or influence our business (output or revenue). This is measured through various indicators such as interpretation of public perception (Public Affairs team), potential for any water disruption (Global Supply Management team), potential for legal costs (Public Affairs and Sustainability or EHS Legal Team), or any noticeable impact on our business (revenue impacts or the inability to work in certain areas of the world). The thresholds we use to determine if something would be considered a substantive change include any impacts to production capabilities or resulting revenues, damages to our public image, and changing regulations that would limit our ability for growth or incur a significant cost (such as new water-related costs that could increase operating costs by several million dollars per site). These criteria apply to our direct operations as well as our ability to continue working with our major suppliers.

When prioritizing risks and opportunities our strategic pillars are the starting point.  However, we do identify natural disasters and other climate related exposures as part of our process.  As it relates to prioritization, consideration is also given to the following items:  impact; both internal and external influences; our current capability and prior experience in mitigating such risks; as well as our expectations of the future outlook for the identified risk.   For our operations, we define water-related risks that could cause ‘substantive’ change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure as those which could impact our strategic sites located in areas of “High” or “Extremely High” overall water risk as defined by WRI Aqueduct. Our strategic sites are those that are critical to operations such as our manufacturing facilities or corporate headquarters. Each site is reviewed annually through WRI Aqueduct and assessed in terms of overall water risk, business growth and strategy. To date, we have not identified a water-related risk for our strategic sites which could cause a substantive change in our business.

Interruption of production could present a change, depending on the product(s) impacted. This change could be substantive, due to the customer need for the product, the revenue we derive from the product, and/or the expenditure required to prevent interruption or to restore production.*Note: CDP's phrasing of "substantive" and our response to questions presenting "substantive" risks should not be considered to relate to matters or facts that could be deemed “material” to a reasonable investor as referred to under U.S. securities laws or similar requirements of other jurisdictions. Investors should rely on disclosures in our Annual ("10-k") filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of "material" matters
A risk management working team is maintained to assess and report overall strategic and operational risks found in our operations and supply chain. When risks hit certain material thresholds or causes substantive change, the committee reports those risks to company management and the board of directors.Juniper prioritizes risks found to be material. Materiality of an issue is assessed as follows:• The value, or risk, of the issue to business operations: Using our corporate strategy, Juniper looks at whether the issue represents a significant risk or opportunity to our company or industry? Is it current or emerging? Is it already part of the Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability strategy or does it need to be added? • The priority of the issue to our stakeholders: Does this issue resonate with our key stakeholders? Is it a subject of NGO campaigns? How does it track in the media? Is it reflected in pending legislation, regulations, or international agreements?• Peers & competitors: Do Juniper’s peers and competitors disclose against this issue? How do they respond?• Juniper’s influence over the issue: To what extent does Juniper have control or influence over the issue through our direct actions, industry associations, or networks?• Relevant and applicable voluntary global reporting and corporate social responsibility standards and guidelines: Is the issue addressed by the standard disclosures of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct, or by other relevant and applicable global voluntary standards?Juniper’s approach to materiality is aligned with the domain solutions & customer verticals of our business strategy. The strategy (referred to as our 2-3-7 strategy) provides a structure & hierarchy for prioritizing the value, or risk, of an issue on Juniper’s business operations. It is based on the following approach: Is this issue critical to our customer segments (Telecom, Financial Services, Cable/MSO, National Government, Cloud Providers & Strategic Enterprise Verticals)? Is this issue relevant to our product domains (Campus & Branch, Access & Aggregation, Edge, Core, Data Center, & Cloud Services)?  Risks found to be material are then acted on through various management methods.

Kellogg defines substantive change as including but not limited to plant relocation, curtailment of operations, product relocation, interruptions in availability, increased cost for municipal water, increased cost for raw materials, lack of security of supply of raw materials, and significant investment in water reduction/recycling. The metrics for this would include increased costs, lack of availability causing shut downs, and increased water treatment. The threshold for these indicators would vary from facility to facility but would be assessed against profit and loss and operational budgets. This covers both operations and supply chain.

More than 30% decrease in plant production output or revenue, or 30% increase in operating cost expenditure due to insufficient water supply or increased cost of water supply.
Kimberly-Clark's tissue business is water intensive and relies significantly on the availability of adequate supplies. We define Substantive Change as any interruption in the water supply that would directly curtail production and force the shutdown of the facility until the water supply is restored. For any expansion or new greenfield site, the availability of adequate fresh water supply is very important. Because of this, all new expansions or new tissue machines will employ state-of-the-art water conservation technologies, and, new wastewater plants will employ the latest technology in water recycling. These efforts incur a higher expenditure than traditional technologies. The threshold for substantive change and risk is 1% or more of global production capacity, which applies to direct operations. The risk is evaluated annually and the risk mitigation plan is implemented and adjusted based on the analysis. Since water reporting began, there have been no water-related business or operational issues greater than the 1% production threshold.

Although an official end to the drought has been declared, Kingston will continue to use conservation gained from the drought in California.  Taiwan is also experiencing drought effects.  Changes to the business would only be affected by water usage and restrictions for personnel on-site.  Water is minimally used in the production process for stencil cleaning, and alternative methodologies for replacing stenciling requiring water cleaning continue and expected to be realized in the next year or two.
As we use a lot of water for the manufacturing of our products, a decrease in the quantity of water available could greatly affect our operations and push us towards paying to receive tankers of water which is very expensive
Substantive change or impact would be anything that would inhibit Lexmark from deliver products or services to our customers on time or on schedule.  Such interruptions to business and operations could impact revenues and agreements with our customers.

Lockheed Martin considers water-related risks to be location specific but currently does not deem water to pose a material impact to our business. For the purposes of Water CDP disclosure, we would define substantive change from water-related risks as those that are present within certain regions where we or key suppliers operate that could lead to a 1% deviation from normal business operations (e.g. increased process time, disrupted material flow, supply chain delay, etc.) and/or a change in revenue or costs to the affected facility and/or supplier caused by a water shortage, regulatory water restriction, water-related natural catastrophe, or other water-related impact. Water impacts currently do not constitute 1% of deviation in our normal business operations or our supply chain, and thus do not constitute a substantive change.Lockheed Martin is not in a water intensive industry and therefore does not encounter conflicts with other water users at a local level. Our current water quantity and quality meet our demands without materially impacting the water basins in which we operate. If water were to be identified by our stakeholders in our Core Issues Assessment as a high priority factor, we would consider evolving our definition of substantive change to reflect our stakeholders’ concerns and address specific water issues with targeted goals. We will continue to evaluate whether our internal and external stakeholders consider water to be a material impact in the future.

Marriott International is a global lodging company with more than 6,000 properties (as of year-end 2016) that we operate (“manage”), franchise or license under 30 brands in 122 countries and territories worldwide. This diversification offers some resilience against localized water risks. A substantive change would be one that would impact overall revenue significantly.

We consider sites that are consistently measured as high risk against three separate criteria to represent a substantive water-related risk to the business. We regard these sites as high priorities for our water stewardship program. The criteria are:1) Sites experiencing the greatest water-related risks and issues as identified in our annual watershed governance survey (see Further Information, below).2) Sites in locations of high (>40%) baseline water stress as per the WRI Aqueduct tool. 3) Sites producing more than 5% of global production volume for one of our Chocolate, Drinks, Food or businesses. For our Petcare business, which has far more sites, we identify those producing more than 2% of total production volume. The proportion of production volume is an indicator of potential business impact in the event of water issues affecting a factory’s ability to operate.Sites identified as high-risk against the above three criteria are the subject of a water stewardship review to ensure we have a detailed understanding of local water risks and opportunities. We are currently developing this process, with a pilot in progress at the Food segment’s Kings Lynn site in the UK and two further reviews underway at two sites in China. We aim to complete this review at existing high-priority locations before year-end 2020, and at all new production sites from 2017 onward.Four sites identified as "at risk" in our 2016 response are not considered "at risk" this year. These sites were in Belgium (Schelde), US (Mississippi), Australia and the UK (unknown watersheds). These sites have addressed their issues of concern as described in the "response strategy" area of our 2016 response, and their risk level has been downgraded according to the criteria described above. In our supply chain, we have overlaid our raw material origins with watersheds, to cross-reference water-intensive crops with areas of water stress to identify priority watersheds that present a substantive supply risk. We have used the results to develop science-based targets for reducing water impacts, based on sustainable watershed levels. More information on this approach is available at www.wri.org/blog/2016/04/companies-could-profit-setting-water-targets-informed-science.

Material risks are assessed at the company level and are those risks that 1) expose the Company to significant or catastrophic permanent decline in shareholder value and 2) the risk must be reasonably possible.
Merck's annual report (form 10-K) defines "substantial" risks as those that could materially adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.  Risks that rise to this level are captured and discussed in our 10-K in section 1.A, Risk Factors.  For more information see http://www.merck.com/investors/At the facility / supply chain level, "substantial" would be any impact that could disrupt, delay or inhibit the supply of our product to the patients.

Risk assessments completed to date have determined that at present our business is not exposed to water risks that could generate a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure. Substantive change for offices/labs would require significantly altering, closing or relocating the operations of a facility/group of facilities. This could include impacts on employees and/or technology equipment. Our operational analysis includes a 3-part filter to identify those facilities representing the greatest potential risk: 1) location in water basins with current or future potential for high baseline water stress; 2) annual average electricity use >60 kWh/square foot (large electricity users being datacenters); and 3) if the facility represents >1% of total companywide electricity use (using electricity as proxy for the size or relative importance of the facility to our company). We review our approach annually when we respond to the CDP water questionnaire, reassessing our risk assessment procedures and looking for opportunities to formalize/integrate risk assessments across the company. Similarly, substantive change for datacenters would entail the need to significantly alter, close or relocate a datacenter in response to water risk that would affect our ability to deliver continuous customer services. We engage all utilities (water/sewer/power/fiber) during site selection due diligence. Capacity and quality are vetted and service agreements put in place prior to completing the transaction. Where future expansion plans are unknown, we obtain commitment letters from the utilities indicating they can provide for future demand (often subject to expansion of existing infrastructure). We do not locate datacenters where utility constraints would prevent us from operating those facilities.Risk for manufacturing sites is defined per our ISO 14001 Significant Aspects and Impacts process and is not considered substantive.These definitions apply to direct operations only. In FY16, we initiated a comprehensive company-wide assessment of vulnerabilities to the physical impacts of climate change (including sea-level rise, flooding from intense precipitation, drought frequency/intensity), focusing on a subset of high-value facilities in locations likely subject to these impacts; once complete, the findings will be integrated into future risk assessments.

We use and depend on about 4,000,000 gallons of water per day for our process production.
A substantive change to our organization for both our direct operation and supply chain is one that is material to the company. To understand the potential for substantive change, our risk identification and assessment process goes through a multi-pronged approach.  We rate risks on factors such as impact, severity, frequency, and likelihood.  We temper this with a look into our controls/mitigations in place or in process.  This process is conducted on an ongoing basis, but reported out to the executives on a quarterly cadence.  Our rating scale has several elements such as financial impact, regulatory, customer impact, reputational, etc. Water related risks including water scarcity and extreme storms are included in these analyses of the potential for substantive risk. For example, droughts, such as the one that was in California or the current one in Bangalore could have an impact on operating expenses at our Sunnyvale facility (if tiered water rates change) as well as on capital expenditures if we are required to retrofit some of our existing cooling towers to reduce the consumption of domestic water. In addition, water availability could affect the prices of our components, since a number of our suppliers (e.g., semiconductor manufacturers) can use significant amounts of water in their manufacturing processes.

Substantive change is defined as a significant operation change or expenditure greater than $1 million. Elements of substantive change include the following:- Rapidly increasing social, political and media concern leading to project delays, increased costs- Increasing pressure on water use due to in-migration of communities in proximity to our operations that could impact our operations- Water scarcity and water surplus leading to production constraints and increased costs- Increasingly stringent regulations focused on water management and discharge requirements leading to increased costs- Increasing financial exposure at closure due to increasingly stringent regulations and water treatment costs
NIPSCO electric generation relies on adequate water for appropriate non-contact cooling of operational equipment. Insufficient water would limit our ability to operate. NIPSCO operates in areas of good water quantity. As such, the probability of a substantive effect is low yet theoretically possible.
We produce aluminum sheet and light gauge products for use in multiple markets, which includes beverage can.  Our single largest end-use market is beverage can sheet. The beverage market is highly dependent on fresh clean water as a key raw material, within the manufacturing process and other product ingredients.  Certain of our customers in the beverage market are significant to our revenues, and we could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of these significant customers or by the loss of their business.
NRG’s definition of substantive water risk is the possibility that an event will occur and significantly alter the achievement of NRG’s business goals.  Risk identification and assessment process applies to both direct operations and supply chain.NRG uses the measures, metrics and indicators for water risk assessment leveraging the management and professional judgment from the following perspectives:•Financial impact:    1)Corporate earnings   2)Capital expenditure on technologies to reduce water consumption and withdrawal •Plant operation    1)Operation disruption due to water shortage   2)Increase in costs of water usage   3)Supply chain risk•Environmental impact   1)Water availability    3)Water quality of river basins   4)Regulations that impact supply and/or management of waterWater risk is monitored by the risk owners (individual plant operators) and reported to management upon material changes with a threshold of 20% in water consumption and withdrawal levels.  If it is determined that a water supply risk exists that could impact projected generation levels within any plant within the subsequent two year time frame, risk mitigation efforts are identified and economically evaluated for implementation.  NRG receives some of our solid and liquid fuel by barge delivery. Water risk regarding the impact for barge delivery is evaluated on a daily basis, with contingency plans developed as needed.  NRG SVP, Plant Operations reviews modelling scenarios generated for water risk determination.Plant level NRG Water usage analysis is reviewed annually.NRG water usage analysis is reviewed by the senior leaders of NRG Operations, Engineering and Commercial Operations.

We have established financial thresholds for determining 'substantive' change for the purposes of CDP reporting. These thresholds take in to account direct operations and supply chain. Impacts in any given quarter of above $7M in revenue loss and/or $4M in additional Cost of Goods Sold or Operating Expenses, are considered substantive.

Water quality and quantity both represents risks and opportunities.  Water is used throughout the project life-cycle of oil and gas activities, for our chemical production and power generation and is core to business continuity. Oxy's HESMS and risk management approach identifies, assesses and grades significant (actual and potential) water-related risks. The HESMS sets consistent worldwide performance expectations and standards across each business segment's respective operations. The HESMS facilitates compliance with laws and regulations and the management of HES and water risks to improve overall business performance. Oxy manages its own water use consistent with community interests near our operations and to avoid adversely impacting the environment, or our license to operate in these communities. Oxy works with IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues. Through a combination of practical tools, reporting practices and working group forums for sharing industry knowledge, IPIECA enables the oil and gas industry to proactively identify potential water risks and to manage water issues.  For example, water scarcity is a prominent issue in the Permian Basin (West Texas and Southeast New Mexico) where, as reported by the U.S. Geologic Society and Texas Alliance, the majority of oil and gas wells are in a “high or extremely high water stress area.” These prevailing water scarcity risks are factored into Oxy’s business plans and water use strategy to operationalize and mitigate risks, and also to identify and seize opportunities that could provide costs savings or generate revenues. Our current oil and gas development plans factor the risk associated with future scarcity of fresh water, especially in Southeast New Mexico. Investing in solutions to treat a larger capacity of produced water delivers value to our operations. We mitigate safety-related risks and save money from minimizing the handling/trucking of water, disposal costs and providing operational continuity to treat large volumes of water if a disposal system goes down.Oxy’s social responsibility website and the Form 10-K provides a detailed discussion of risk factors, including those which can be water-related such as governmental actions, climate change and catastrophic events (hurricanes, floods and droughts).
Omnicom Group and its subsidiaries is a professional services company. We do not use water beyond what is normally used in an office setting, ie restrooms, water fountains & kitchens.
Operations at a few plants require a significant quantity of water. Therefore, water related risks have the potential to cause substantial change in direct business operations. Depending on severity and the likelihood of water challenges derived from the watershed/basin, it might impact local business units as well as revenue or expenditure at global level. To determine the included facilities we identify all sites listed as having "high" or "extremely high" overall water risk from the Aqueduct Tool.  We then cross reference that with our water use and production levels at each of those sites. To be considered significant the total amount of production from those sites within the basin must be above 3%. Once plants cross both the high risk and 3% production in the basin threshold they are considered to have the potential of substantive change on our business. We use our supplier segmentation process to identify those suppliers that are critical to our operations based on a variety of risk factors including availability of substitutions and level of spend. Based on the results of the segmentation process suppliers representing 87% of our spend go through additional water risk assessments including the Aqueduct Tool.

PepsiCo incorporates the following factors when defining substantive change in PepsiCo’s direct operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk: 1) magnitude of potential impact on operating costs and/or current and future revenue; and 2) potential impact on stakeholder expectations or perceptions.  Substantive change would generally be considered any material change (+/- 5%) to a site's operating environment/costs and/or to PepsiCo reputation locally, regionally or globally.  Should such material change occur, the impact (and any potential need to review the definition) would be reviewed and re-assessed by our senior executive team.  This definition of substantive change applies to both direct operations and to elements of our supply chain (such as change to agricultural raw material sourcing from water-related risks).

PG&E published the results of a third-party led materiality assessment, a project designed to help identify topics that are “material” priorities for the long-term sustainability of our business. The assessment was developed through a structured process that included interviews with internal and external stakeholders. The assessment identified “water” as one of the material topics, which was defined as “maintaining water quality and availability through company operations and ensuring the short- and long-term availability of water for other uses.”More details are available at:http://www.pgecorp.com/corp_responsibility/reports/2016/su02_materiality.jsp

For the purposes of this response, Pfizer defines “substantive” risk as any impact that could adversely impact the company’s business or financial condition or disrupt, delay or inhibit the supply of medically-necessary products to patients. CDP's phrasing of "substantive" and our response to questions presenting "substantive" risks should not be considered to relate to matters or facts that could be deemed “material” to a reasonable investor as referred to under U.S. securities laws or similar requirements of other jurisdictions. Investors should refer to disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ("10-k") and in our other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K, for a discussion of "material" matters.

In relation to substantive change, we refer to materiality - material issues are identified in a multidisciplinary way and include those which:• have the highest potential impact and a realistic probability of occurrence;• are most relevant to our enterprises and geographic locations; and• are most important to our stakeholders.In 2020+ risk forecasting terms, higher level risks are defined as those with a potential impact in excess of US$5M or a raw material impact in excess of 1000 metric tonnes of tobacco leaves.  These apply to both our direct operations and our tobacco supply chain.Over the last couple of years, we have been expanding our water programs by first assessing current and future water-related risks more broadly across our value chain. These risks include water scarcity and water quality in tobacco growing regions, flood risk in major tobacco warehouse locations and ports, and water demand in cities where we have manufacturing facilities.
APS defines substantive change to our business related to water risk in three ways.  First, a physical disruption of a water supply constitutes a substantive and disruptive change.  If a vital piece of infrastructure is damaged or becomes inoperable, output could be impacted or generation could be curtailed entirely. Second, noncompliance with a permit or regulatory requirement could impact production and/or result notices of violations and penalties. Finally, allocation cuts related to water shortages would impact production.
  Our water management approach is based on a global mapping process that enables us to establish relative water risks in our portfolio and rank our sites based on water usage, scarcity risk and other factors. We update the ranking each year to reflect water usage changes and sites that are acquired or sold.

Substantive change from water related risks would mainly relate to water availability for use in our phosphate operations and water-related regulatory requirements (mainly water quality/discharges). Substantive change would be considered a change in the water supply availability which could impact production levels and product availability which could cause a deviation from the company’s desired strategic results. Substantive change related to water-related regulatory requirements would include international, federal and state regulatory initiatives that may result in new regulatory restrictions on discharges of nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, to waters in the United States (“Nutrient Criteria”). These Nutrient Criteria could have a material effect on either the Company or its customers, but the impact is not currently predictable or quantifiable with reasonable certainty because many of these initiatives are in relatively early stages and compliance alternatives may be available that do not create material impacts.
Qualcomm’s annual risk assessment of our operations includes the consideration, review and prioritization of various company risks by a cross-functional group of key representatives from legal, finance, human resources and internal audit. A substantive change for both our direct operations and our supply chain is one that is material to the company. When conducting a risk assessment to identify material risks, we consider the scale of the potential financial impact and the likelihood of the impact on our key business drivers, including employee attraction and retention, future growth strategy, innovation, meeting customers’ needs, and supply chain management.
A substantive impact would be defined as one that would impact our operations to the point where we could not meet our customers' needs.  This would be defined as us not being able to meet our production quotas due to water risks or lack of availability.  This would apply to our suppliers and our direct operations.  We do not see a current or near term risk in our water scarce area operations.  We recognize that in many cases, our suppliers are located in the same watersheds as our operations.  We recognize we must work to encourage our suppliers to also minimize their water usage.
A substantive impact would be defined as one that would impact our operations to the point where we could not meet our customers' needs.  This would be defined as us not being able to meet our production quotas due to water risks or lack of availability.  This would apply to our suppliers and our direct operations.  We do not see a current or near term risk in our water scarce area operations.  We recognize that in many cases, our suppliers are located in the same watersheds as our operations.  We recognize we must work to encourage our suppliers to also minimize their water usage.
We define substantive change from risk in our business to be when we have lost >20% of the margin after market (MAM) in our direct operations. We have developed aggressive business continuity plans that enable us to restore our business to the 80% MAM level quickly by focusing on our key product brands.  These plans are reviewed every year and revised if necessary. Mock exercises based on the plans are conducted as needed.
 Rockwell defines substantive change to our business to be when more than 5% of operations, revenue or expenditure is impacted, at the corporate level. This threshold is then applied to reporting water-related substantive risks. For example, if a supply-chain is disrupted as a result of prolonged drought in one region and this contributes to a reduction in production globally but it is less than 5% at the corporate level. Consequently this risk would NOT be reported in question W3.2d as an example of a water risk that could cause a substantive change to business, operations, revenue or expenditure as it did not exceed the threshold for substantive change to our business at the corporate level.

Sempra Energy’s 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission identifies the risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.  The 10-K identifies a few risk factors that are or could be a result of water-related issues, particularly drought.   However, for transparency purposes, in this response we have also included additional water-related risks that we have identified.  These risks do not meet the threshold of materiality relevant to our 10-K filing, but we believe are useful in providing to context to the significance of water in our operations and supply chain and therefore merit inclusion in this discussion.

Using the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool, we determined which major manufacturing and distribution facilities were located in water-stressed regions (having a "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk as determined by the tool) .  Substantive change will depend on how much product is produced or distributed from that facility as a percentage of total operations.

A substantive change would be defined as disruption in operations lasting one day or more. For instance, if it was impossible to provide sufficient drinking water to workers and offices needed to be evacuated or activities on construction site would have to stop.
A substantive change would be defined as disruption in operations lasting one day or more. For instance, if it was impossible to provide sufficient drinking water to workers and offices needed to be evacuated or activities on construction site would have to stop.To date, the main water related risk SNC-Lavalin has been exposed to is floods. In the past years urban areas where we have permanent offices such as Calgary and Houston have been severely impacted by floods. In addition, major clients' projects were completed in arid regions such as mines in Chile and smelters in UAE. In those cases, sustainable sources of water needed to be assessed both for the construction and operation phases of the designed facilities.
Without continuous flow of water at least one of our facilities is not able to operate
Sprint believes there are some risks associated with water, but does not believe these risks are material (per SEC reporting guidelines). In Sprint's direct operations, water is used in evaporative chiller systems to cool data centers, and large network and commercial office locations. Sprint defines substantive change from water risk as a forced replacement of operational equipment with alternative technology. “Substantive change” is based on the Base Water Stress level (2010) obtained by inputting data about Sprint's sites into WBCSD's Global Water Tool used to identify water stressed in river basins associated with our US based operations. We combined our facility water usage information with the information from WBCSD and found that 14 of Sprint’s top 50 water usage sites (76% of its consumption in 2016) are in extremely high water stressed areas. Through Sprint's Trucost analyses in recent years, we also have been able to assess the scope of water consumed in its supply chain. Sprint's supply chain accounts for more than 99% of the company's overall water footprint.

Substantive change would be any change considered material to our financial results, such as impacting a significant number of stores in a region, as well as changes which would require significant capital investment.  We review our business annually during development of our operating plan and review progress against this quarterly.  While local water issues such as the Flint water crisis or the California drought have had impacts on our operations on stores in those regions, the financial impact was not significant enough to deem this a financial risk to Starbucks.  We recognize those water challenges are serious in those communities, Starbucks is always doing it's best to help, whether it's providing safe drinking water or installing drought tolerant landscaping, Starbucks always aims to be good community water stewards.
For direct operations we define the potential for substantive change in our business, operations, revenue, or expenditure from water risks as our facilities that generally score 16 or over on our internal Total Water Risk Index metric within our enterprise water risk assessment process (Water Risk Plan).Stanley Black & Decker (SBD) global Water Risk Plan has foundation in our 2012 strategic communication, a 2013 launch of our global water scarcity strategy, and 2014-16 updates including establishment of 2015 re-baseline global water withdrawal intensity and 2020 reduction target of such.  This in-process management method includes mapping SBD global locations against the United Nations Environment Program's vital water graphic layers for a multi-faceted risk evaluation to prioritize top water risk sites; then instituting water conservation efforts, governmental collaboration projects, and options for alternative water strategies at high risk sites.  We also use this management method to assess water risk potential during acquisition transaction due diligence.

The inability to manufacture our products and run our chemical processes due to either poor water quality or lack of available water would represent a substantive impact from water risks.
Suncor uses an enterprise-wide risk management system (ERM) to assess and define risk. Like most ERM systems it uses a matrix that determines the consequence of a risk and the likelihood.  There are six (6) consequence and likelihood categories. The ERM assign risks a ranking from I to IV for economic, environmental and social. Social is further broken down into Health & Safety, Reputation and Regulatory with guidance. Suncor defines substantive risks that are risked rank at II or I; To define substantive change for the purpose of this assessment; an economic value of $10M was used. This includes direct financial costs and lost opportunity value (LOV).
For the purpose specifically of assessing water risk, a business change would be considered substantive if it resulted in a change in expenditure and/or revenue of 5% or more. A change would also be considered substantive if it directly impacts our corporate reputation and/or brand value and/or if it directly affects the wellbeing of our employees. This definition encompasses our direct operations and supply chain.

Substantive change in our direct operations is measured primarily by financial impact. With respect to water, substantive change is based upon a high-level assessment of water risks at our operating locations that could result in a "High" or "Very High" financial impact based on EBITDA and a "highly likely/imminent" or "frequently" likelihood as defined in Sysco’s proprietary Risk Rating Criteria. Estimated CY2016 EBITDA at risk is used to determine the appropriate Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High financial impact category, while likelihood of the risk is used to determine the extremely unlikely, unlikely, occasionally, highly likely/imminent, and frequently likelihood category.

We define substantive change as those having a significant or material impact to our sales, expenses, or ability to source product from certain regions of the world.
Currently, we monitor the availability of water in the areas where we operate, but have no concerns that would require substantive changes in our operations (such as any changes to our manufacturing output.)
Substantive change for our business as it relates to water availability would be lack of water necessary to conduct our manufacturing operations in a manner that complies with all applicable food safety regulatory requirements and standards.  Lack of water could be from on-site sources or from water supply sources, and could include significant curtailment of typical water supply needed to run the operation.  Another aspect of risk would be the ability to obtain ingredients that rely on adequate water supply for crop harvesting to meet production based on customer demands.

Water risks are defined as facilities where the baseline water stress is high or extremely high, or facilities where a flood risk has been determined.
Water risks are defined as facilities where the baseline water stress is high or extremely high, or facilities where a flood risk has been determined.
A water risk causing substantive change to our business would include a water shortage or water quality issue.
We are committed to the responsible management of our water resources, and acknowledge that significant changes in water availability could have an impact on our company and supply chain. For example, significant changes in water availability could result in plant relocations, closure or reduced capacity; curtailment of operations due to interruptions in water availability; financial investments in water management/recycling/reuse technologies beyond those currently in place; increased cost for municipal water; or increased cost for raw materials or lack of a supply of raw materials.

We define substantive as having a material financial impact on the entire enterprise.  Although some facilities may be subject to water risks, such risks at the enterprise level are not financially material.  Also water was not one of the top-ranked issues in our sustainability survey.  At the same time, we see a growing opportunity for us to continue to innovate products and services that help our customers be more resource efficient, including reducing water consumption.

Union Pacific integrates water risks/opportunities into a multi-disciplinary Company-wide risk management process. Union Pacific utilizes an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process to incorporate input from Strategic Planning, Operations, Law, and the Environmental Management Group, among others, to identify potential water related risks and opportunities. Each element plays a role in the management of risks and opportunities and evaluation of materiality and priorities. In each case, the criteria for materiality and priorities are dictated first and foremost by an analysis of impacts to safety. Evaluation of impacts to ethics, customer service, and the environment also dictate materiality and priorities. These criteria and priorities are not mutually exclusive and overlap. Union Pacific assesses these impacts in terms of likelihood and magnitude of the impact, determines a response strategy, and monitors progress.
UTC defines a substantive change to our businesses to be any instance where a UTC site fails to manufacture or deliver products due to disruptions in manufacturing water supply or flooding event, or the need to make substantial investments in site infrastructure in response to climate change water-related impacts.

Forced to alter or move production due to flooding or total lack of available water.
Changes in precipitation patterns result in drought or flood conditions that will impact landfill function, not only in terms of additional costs to maintain operations but also will impact potential revenues from the collection and use of landfill gas for energy. Virtually any of WM’s landfills in the U.S. and Canada are vulnerable to intermittent drought conditions, flood conditions or both.Both flooding and drought impact the behaviors of materials decaying in a controlled MSW landfill environment. Flooding can impede the collection of landfill gas by filling collection wells with water; drought can reduce the rate of decay of organic material because water is essential to the decay process. Both extreme conditions result in additional labor being required to manage the landfill gas collection system, with additional liquids collection required to respond to excess moisture and with adjustments to gas collection system vacuum required to respond to the decrease in gas generation resulting from too little moisture. Also, additional labor and costs are incurred in compliance with regulatory obligations. Also, although WM is not a high volume water user, temporary disruptions in water supply could affect our operations.

WhiteWave employs a multi-disciplinary approach to risk management, with a Board of Directors (BOD) that reviews opportunities or risks identified by our Executive Leadership Team as part of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program (financial, regulatory, compliance, etc.) that would materially impact our objectives. ERM and the Risk Management Oversight Committee (RMOC) in N. America provide periodic updates to executive leadership discussing supply chain issues if they occur/when needed. The Risk Refresh is an annual process where the risk portfolio and risk profiles are reviewed, discussed and tiered based on prioritization methodology. Risks are considered as far into the future as reasonably possible. Sustainability updates are presented to the BOD after the annual environmental inventory is performed and as needed. Lastly, a cross-functional Issues Working Group (IWG) meets monthly to review emerging and ongoing issues affecting our brands, business & industry.For purposes of this survey, we used a screening criteria to identify our direct operational sites and key ingredient suppliers meeting the CDP guidance for "substantive" as follows: 1) sites indicated as "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk per WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter, and 2) which are either considered strategic sites or those which account for >5% of global production volume.
There are not constraints on our operations related to water use due to our Great Lakes basin and Mississippi River basin operating locations. Therefore, we do not have metrics used to define substantive change to our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk.

Assuming a lead role in sustainability requires a focused effort on aspects that will drive the greatest value to our stakeholders and company and we utilize materiality assessments to prioritize this effort. Xerox’s formal CSR materiality assessment process considers relevant sustainability/CSR topics impacting Xerox products, services, processes and operations, including water in our operations and supply chain. Each topic is assessed for both importance to our stakeholders as well as significance of positive and negative impacts to the economy/society/environment from Xerox’s operations, products and facilities. Each topic is given a numerical score against the criteria to aid prioritization. Results are presented via a matrix so the importance of the topics can be visually presented. Subject matter experts are identified for all the high risk/opportunity issues and are responsible for defining and implementing necessary actions to respond to the issues identified. We prioritize the risks in terms of current risk profile as well as the projected risk profile on completion of the risk mitigation plans. Opportunities are prioritized on relative effort (measured by cost, time and intangibles) and benefit (measured by revenue opportunity, reduced liability and intangibles). In 2016 water was identified as a low risk material aspect.However, we have identified specific facilities within our direct operations exposed to water risk that could generate “a substantive change in our business operations, revenue or expenditure” based on meeting the following criteria:1.Facility locations classified as water stressed or water scarce according to publically available water tools (WBCSD Global Water Tool, WWF Water Risk Filter and WRI Aqueduct)2.Consideration of internal company knowledge (e.g. from the materiality processes described above) regarding the local water situation, the facility type, size and strategic importance and thus potential to impact/reduce global revenue (i.e. the Technology business represents ~60% total global revenue). E.g toner manufacturing operations use water as raw material and thus, in the event of a future water restriction, have the potential for operations to be impacted resulting in potential additional costs associated with switching toner production to an alternative site. Also large office/R&D facilities (i.e. >100 employees)

We assess water risk according to the potential impact on any of our major generating facilities. To the extent that water risks may inhibit the ability of any of our major units to deliver reliable electricity to the market and meet market demand, that risk is considered to have a potential to create substantive change.  We assess water risk including drought, flooding, availability, and quality risks that could impact our ability to operate reliably.

To define a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk, we consider an estimated potential financial impact in excess of $5 million as a threshold quantitative metric. In evaluating and estimating the potential financial impact, we consider numerous factors, including the proportion of business units affected, size of the impact on those business units, and degree of stakeholder concern. We also consider interdependencies among potential risks, and utilize the process of responding to the CDP Water Information Request annually to review and update our assessments.
Substantive change to our business as it relates to water risk is based upon our assessment of water risks at our global data centers and offices, inclusive of our direct operations only (not including our supply chain). Substantive change would be one that increased operational expenditure on water in excess of 1% of total annual company spend. Since total expenditure on water and wastewater combined is far less than this, we do not anticipate substantive change to occur. From an operational perspective, substantive change for facilities would include a requirement to significantly alter, close, and/or relocate the operations of a particular facility or group of facilities. Based on the results of our water risk assessment, there are no facilities that are sited in regions with identified water risk or stress that can generate a substantive change to occur. 																				
Our water risk is embodied at both the restaurant and supply chain level. Our most basic quantitative metric that indicates exposure to water risks that could generate substantive change in our restaurant operations –is currently a Composite Risk Score of 3.00 or higher in our WRI Aqueduct assessment. Although this assessment has not been completed within the supply chain, risk would be defined as events that create increased costs, disruption or shortages. In both cases it includes any damage to the reputation our reputation or brand image.Water risk is incorporated into the Company's broader risk management process. Water issues and initiatives are driven in partnership between the Sustainability, Corporate Communications, Legal, and Financial teams, and other key functions as relevant. These teams work together to identify substantive risks to our business and Company-owned operations that could potentially occur and work with our divisions and business units to mitigate the risks. Risks, including water risks, are prioritized based on a number of factors that impact our organization and could create substantive change, including but not limited to regulatory, operational and reputational. More specifically, we look at the likelihood, size, and scope of the factors and the number of business units/divisions impacted. In addition, we consider the length of the factors’ impact and assess whether the impact is a one-time occurrence or recurring in nature. We then make a determination whether or not it is more effective in both the short and long-term to modify, adjust or alter our business strategy given the risks. While we do not believe that individual instances of water risk would constitute a substantive risk on their own due to the total size, decentralized nature and our ability to source from different regions of the globe if it became necessary, the potential cumulative impact of water stress on could become substantive over the long term. Due to the uncertain nature of climate change on future water stress and availability, we cannot say with certainty the timeframe or level of impact.
Zimmer Biomet utilizes “high-purity water” or HPW in some medical device applications. HPW processed to be utilized at the point of use is the only material authorized in certain applications where the cleanliness and bio-burden of a device require strict control & validated outcomes. In this context a substantive change would be defined as potable water available to produce HPW severely restricted or not available in the volumes required to successfully execute medical device manufacturing operations.
We define substantive change from water risks, to our direct operations, to include:- sanctions corresponding to an interruption of production or cessation of activity for a short-term but finite duration; - significant, longer-term or offsite community or environmental impact requiring significant mitigation or additional long-term controls; and/or, - financially, we define a substantive change to an operation by using a cost threshold.
The Company’s operations and properties are subject to extensive laws, ordinances, regulations, and otherlegal requirements relating to environmental protection.  These include legal requirements governing investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties as well as water discharges, air emissions, waste management and workplace health and safety. Such legal requirements frequently change and vary among jurisdictions. The Company’s operations and properties must comply with these legal requirements. These requirements may have a material adverse effect on operations.

Any long term deviation, as related to CDP reports, with a magnitude of greater than $200 M cash flow impact or certain other key parameters, such as production rate, waste management, and increase in capital/operational cost etc., were considered substantive change, whether it be our operations or a contract manufacturer. . In the reporting year of 2015, our risk assessment process has become more robust and is now considering more components beyond dollar factors and has now advanced to include the following. Production operations generally requires years of engineering design, environmental impact study, permit application and construction to be developed. Once constructed, every facility follows a plan that schedules the annual production rate, waste management and environmental remediation etc. from operation to closure and post closure. We consider a wide range of risk factors in our corporate level risk monitoring and assessment, aligning strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge in order to evaluate and manage uncertainties the company faces.Risks are understood and evaluated using the Western Digital qualitative risk analysis process, including cash flow impact, facility key parameters, such as production rate, waste management, and increase in capital/operational cost etc. License to operate components are also included in the assessment. Environmental risks could trigger water related consequences. Western Digital’s Resource Conservation Program requires each facility to perform a water risk assessment on an annual basis. As part of this exercise, in 2015, the risk thresholds were reviewed in light of developments in the business to ensure they are meaningful, and amended as appropriate. Western Digital is also developing a comprehensive Resource Management goals to support assessment and mitigation of water related risks, including consideration of: •	-Water Location•	-Water Scarcity•	-Environmental Impacts to water•	-Regulatory compliance on water•	-Water Quality•	-Water Quantity•	-Water Management on Closure•	-Community perception

Varian defines ‘substantive’ on a case-by-case basis, evaluating impacts to operations, supply chain, product quality, customer satisfaction, employee health & safety, and reputation. Potential impacts may include increased capital costs or operational expenditures, disruption or delays in production. Substantive changes are measurable year over year.
Substantive change is defined as 1) an Extremely High risk ranking under the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool or Maplecroft risk software or 2) water risk with financial impacts exceeding levels established by the internal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process (scoring and ranking is reviewed and updated annually).
A substantive risk could include, but may not be limited to, a curtailment or disruption of mine production, prevention of mine expansion opportunities, increased capital expenditure and operational maintenance costs associated with development of alternate and renewable water supplies, or increased capital expenditures and increased operating costs associated with water quality programs and technologies.Please see additional information in the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K.
Avnet could function without substantial impact for up to one week w/o water delivery. We operate in areas where there is adequate water available currently to meet business needs and where there has not been a substantial disruption in 10 years. The company will undertake a water stress analysis and benchmark our water intensity of our direct operations and supply chain in the coming fiscal year.
Water risk is not considered significant at this time, given our location and our practice of use / treat and return of the water to the river source.   This practice is monitored and approved by the local regulatory agency.
All areas where CMC operates have adequate water supply and there have been no instances where water related risks have occurred.  Additionally, CMC uses a relatively low total amount of water as compared to our large scale customers.
We have not defined 'substantive change' at this time. As we look at more data on our facilities and those of our suppliers we will develop this further.
Tessy's definition of a substantive change from water risk would be on direct operations and be the inability to withdraw from local municipalities enough water to operate 60% of Tessy's 247 injection molding presses, which maintains a high enough revenue to pay for operational costs. A 30-day safety stock of critical customer components is warehoused to mitigate this potential change in Tessy's operations and revenue for the short-term.
current waste water analysis is ongoing.
Pinnacle defines substantive change in their business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk using multiple variables - however, the most relevant indicator that is considered is the size of the impact to our business.  Pinnacle understands that climate change can affect crop seasons, water supply, and weather patterns which can have a substantive impact on the way that we do business.  Risk size is determined by financial impact.  As an example, risks are gauged by the dollar impact on earnings, assigned a probability and ranked by the size of the risk. A large portion of key ingredients and materials that we use in our products are highly dependent on the availability of water.  Our supply chain faces the largest risks due to changes in water availability and quantity which in turn, could result in higher costs for Pinnacle as well.  Our Procurement Leadership Team utilizes a supply chain risk management program that is designed to allow the Company to identify and manage risks inherent in its external supply chain, which includes assessing substantive changes in our business due to water risks.  Substantive changes in our supply chains are defined by overall risk and materiality to our business.Our direct operations also rely on the availability of water and our production operations could be impacted by change in weather patterns.  Because of the diversity of agricultural inputs in Pinnacle’s product portfolio, each single item does not create a significant risk and there exists generally supply alternatives. Additionally, the vast amount of Pinnacle’s operations and supply chain are located in North America with limited exposure to broad risks.

Water is a major ingredient is the majority of our products. Water is also used for washouts (clean and sanitize equipment and the plant). Recycled water is also used for cooling products. All of these would affect expenditures if clean water was not readily available.
Hanesbrands defines substantive change from water risk as a condition or set of conditions related to water supply which would result in the curtailment of production at one of its primary operating facilities, to the extent that the company's ability to fulfill customer orders is materially impacted.
Water availability and consistent quality is important to our business and that of our partners, suppliers, and supply chain because SCJ manufactures consumer products that contain water.
A “Substantial change” for the company is defined as plus or minus a 3% change in annual gross revenue.
Our operating mines are located in arid or semi-arid regions. We source water from groundwater wells or pipe water over long distances, with the exception of New Afton, which sources water from Kamloops Lake. Almost all of the water used at our sites is associated with the processing of ore. We also require water for drilling and for dust control on mine haul roads, and use dust suppressants to minimize evaporative loss. All process water used at our mine sites is contained in a closed circuit, with only evaporation at tailings storage facilities or leach pads and entrainment in tailings and concentrates allowing water to leave the cycle of reuse. Our operating mines are zero discharge facilities, with no process water being released to the surrounding environment. Any impact on our ability to access water for our operations represents a risk to or business.
As a pharmaceutical manufacturer and a business that is dependent upon 500+ external manufacturers, the risk associated with water purity, quality, quantity and availability are vital to the products in our portfolio.

Although we do not use water within our manufacturing processes, we consider our company and supply chain subject to risks related to water, but do not consider the risks to be significant.  Like all companies, extreme weather events and resource shortages have the potential to interrupt our business and supply chain operations.  However, Motorola Solutions' operations generally are not located in low-lying areas subject to severe impacts from flooding.  Any disruption to our distribution channels could have a detrimental impact on our supply chain and product distribution.  Losses and interruption could be caused by water shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters, for which we predominantly are self-insured.

We have not defined substantive change in the context of water risk.  With high flexibility in our ability to shift production we are not overly concerned with a scenario in which water is unavailable.
Loss of revenue
Substantive change is defined as disruption in supply chain that would result an immediate impact on our ability to provide products to our OEM Customers.
A possible risk would be increase to water costs and disposal rates due to high demand, especially at our facilities having higher water consumption for e-coat purposes.  Although it is difficult to say what is substantive at this time, any increases would impact on our overall business revenues and have to be absorbed.  We do not see changes in water rates changing any current operations.Business growth in the area of 2 of our Mexico facilities may further increase demand on water resources and water quality in these areas.
Substantive change in business is defined as designing fewer new products, outsourcing process out of state...etc.
Lack of water may impact manufacturing operations where water is used. The manufacturing operations may have to obtain water externally or other sources which could be expensive, may be difficult to obtain and increase the cost of operations.In the U.S. the river basins or rivers adjacent to the locations where the factories are : Susquehanna River, Nashua River, Ohio River.In Germany the locations are supported by local rivers: Neckar river, Teltow canal.
We are a food processor, so water risk for us means the threat of cost increase or production disruption. This cost increase or production disruption can occur in water-intensive and weather-vulnerable operations, and in the supply chain that provides our inputs. Disruption could include cut-off of municipal water supply due to maintenance or drought at our processing facilities or flooding of communities where we have facilities. In our supply chain, disruption could include weather events that result in seasonal shifts in availability or that change the timing and available quantity of harvest.  In general, we think about water risk in agriculture mainly as a potential contributor to cost, rather than as a production disruption. A total lack of availability of avocados in a particular region could occur in the future as a result of extreme weather events or drought, but usually such events affect supply without destroying it entirely. Additionally, we source avocados from very different geographies and ecosystems, so the likelihood of all of them experiencing stress at the same time is unlikely. Accordingly, we believe that the main risk driver in agriculture is exposure to cost risk.Furthermore, our water risk related to agriculture stems from (a) the water-related cost risk faced by our suppliers and (b) the water-related cost risk faced by the entire avocado sectors from which we purchase.  In other words, while we may be shielded from some risk by our growers’ practices, we must still purchase – and they can always sell – on spot markets.

Edwards facilities are considered a 'dry' manufacturing plants and do not rely on large volumes of water to maintain the integrity of our manufacturing operations and to provide adequate water for our employees' personal consumption and hygiene.  Our manufacturing and regional offices are situated in locations which typically have good and reliable public and private water systems infrastructure.
Xylem does not have a corporate-wide definition for “substantive change” but since water is integrated into every component of our business, water risks are a key element of our risk management and business continuity planning. Our risks are managed by a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program that has a corporate framework consisting of five key components: (1) Risk Appetite and Strategy, (2) Governance and Organization, (3) Policies and Procedures, (4) Risk Management Process, and (5) Monitoring and Reporting. This framework directly supports the ERM Program’s objective of establishing “practical and sustainable policies, procedures and processes that help the Company manage and monitor risk effectively.” As such, the Program and its framework provide the means by which Xylem monitors and prioritizes its risks and governs its risk profile.Every Xylem site is also responsible for developing and implementing a site-specific Business Continuity Plan, including as elements Crisis Management Plans and IT Disaster Recovery Plans. Xylem's set of Business Continuity policies sets forth the specific requirements for business continuity responsibility, planning, risk assessment and business impact analysis, reporting and program maintenance. This policy requires Xylem sites to have in place a comprehensive set of business strategies and actions designed to protect safety, minimize the impact of a business interruption and facilitate return to normal operational levels. This process requires sites to evaluate change on a frequent basis and plan for situations that could have a substantive change to our business before they actually do. An analysis of water-related risks will be included in the local Business Continuity Plans for all Xylem facilities. This proactive procedure helps Xylem to mitigate the risks posed by water including increased water scarcity, regulatory uncertainty and declining water quality.
Decreases in quantity or quality of the water available will jeopardize our ability to operate.
Our product is DC/DC Converter, there is no need for water during manufacturing
Hub considers a 10% change in overall revenue or operating costs a substantive change.
Delta Beverages does not believe that our organization is exposed to water risks because we believe that the municipal water supply is capable of providing the required quantity and quality of water for Delta's operations for the foreseeable future. The municipal water supply that feeds Delta Beverages is drawn from Lake Ontario which is one of the largest lakes in North America and the 14th largest lake in the world. That being said, Delta Beverages recognizes the importance of a reliable water supply to its continued business operations. Any disruption to the quantity of water supplied to Delta Beverages would force the organization to temporarily shut down its operations until sufficient water supply resumed. Any operational shut down due to lack of water supply would be considered to be a substantive change to our business operations. Issues with the quality of the water supplied could also temporarily shut down Delta's operations. If these water quality issues continued to persist, it may be necessary for Delta Beverages to make investments in more water treatment equipment. Such expenditure would also be considered a substantive change to our business operations.

Regeneron defines a substantive change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk to be anything that disrupts the business to meet specific levels across five Regeneron Business Impact Criteria. Regeneron considers this to be a low potential risk in the short-term, but understands that limited access to fresh water may affect our long term viability as the company continues to expand into regions with higher water-related risks. This definition only applies to our direct operations and does not include considerations to our suppliers’ water related risks.
Substantive change would typically involve impacts on an expansion of production at a specific site, or the development of expanded production at a new site. A significant change in supply/availability of raw materials could be considered  substantive.
A substantial change may be a new production line, an increase in production. Currently if there is an increase and the demand for water consumption is greater when being located in a hydrographic basin in Mexico, the amount of water is available. We do not have a high risk for this resource.
The facility defines a substantive change when more than 10% is impacted at the corporate level. The management has put in place a contingency plan to address the disruption of production by outsourcing the  affected operation. The E- Coat operation is most likely affected as it heavily relies on water as an integral aspect of the process operation. Consequently outsourcing e-coat services will increase operating expenditures and consequently impact our revenue.
For the Buena plant, a substantive change would be if the aquifer was affected and it was no longer able to be used.  We believe that this risk is extremely low.
As ModusLink’s water consumption is primarily used for human consumption and sanitation, this does not pose significant risks to interruption of production.
Water is an integral part of the paper making process that a percentage of our raw material is produced using.  A shortage of water would have a detrimental impact on these products but they could easily be replaced by film products. It would take time to review our processes, technology, etc. to convert products from paper to film based.  This could require a capital investment on our part to maintain the levels of revenue as a result.
Not applicable.  Our manufacturing process does not contain or utilize water.
PVH’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process identifies risks most material to the business. Risks are ranked based on likelihood and control comfort. Sourcing risk, identified as a top risk through the ERM process, includes the potential for natural disasters (e.g. floods, droughts), and volatile commodity costs, particularly in key sourcing countries. In addition to PVH’s ERM process, we undertook a water risk assessment in 2016. Per WWF’s Water Risk Filter tool, three types of risks are identified; physical risk, reputational risk, and regulatory risk. Physical risk is defined as water quantity (e.g. scarcity, flooding, droughts) and quality (pollution) within the river basin and the impacts this might have on society and the environment. Regulatory risk is defined as the strength and enforcement of water regulations and the consequences of restrictions by public institutions; either felt through direct regulatory action or from neglect, blockages, or failure. Reputational risk is defined as perceptions around water use, pollution, and behavior that may have negative impacts on the company brand and influence purchasing decisions. Public perceptions can emerge rapidly when local aquatic systems and community access to water are affected. Substantive change is defined as changes in availability, continuity, price, quality, delivery time and reliability of the supply base or the public opinion that impacts sourcing performance, sourcing strategy and/or the company reputation.
While water sources are abundant in the DRC and investigations to date indicate that there are multiple potential sources of water supply for the Kipushi and Kamoa-Kakula project. Both projects have continual risk of flooding of the underground infrastructure. Risk management strategies include primary dewatering systems as well as backup systems in case of failure.   The Platreef Project is located in a scarce water area. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to secure sufficient sources and quantities of water, particularly at the Platreef Project, where the Company will need to secure an interest in or water access rights from forthcoming water development projects. The means of such access includes securing the commercial entitlement to the water source, developing the infrastructure to transport it to the Platreef Project and obtaining necessary government and regulatory permits. In addition, in South Africa, where the Platreef Project is located, the National Water Authority imposed a new regime on the use of water resources and requires an integrated water use licence for all water uses. All mining operations require an integrated water use licence for all new water uses and a detailed study of the water balance in the area must precede an application for a licence.
Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials due to water risk may have an adverse impact on profitability. Flowers Foods identifies manufacturing sites that could potentially contribute to substantial change due to water risks as those that meet the following criteria:1) Sites with a) ”High” or “Extremely High” Baseline water stress and b) Projected Annual Renewable Water Supply in 2025 of less than 500 m^3 or 500-1000 m^3 per person (WBCSD Global Water Tool)AND/OR2) A risk score of 3 or higher for "Overall External Risk Rating" for BOTH current and projected risks (WRI Aqueduct)AND3) Account for more than 2% of Flowers Foods' total production volume in 2016.
Substantive change in both our business operations and supply chain would include a reduced level of operations at any single facility such that the individual facility would not be capable of supplying the entire quantity of production needed to meet global commercial demand for that product. Potential negative impacts could include experiencing a reduction in revenues and inability to service therapeutic/medical market demands for the affected product. This substantive change could also negatively impact AbbVie's Research and Development operations and supply chain through a reduction in that organization's ability to promote discovery, development and clinical investigations in new therapeutic areas.

Axalta recognizes that as participants in the global economy we must be stewards of the environment in which we operate. Making coatings involves the use of energy, raw materials and water and results in emissions and wastes of various kinds. In addition, we recognize that industrial processes can pose safety risks to employees and others when not carefully managed. We have programs in place designed to safeguard the health andsafety of our people, products and manufacturing processes, as well as the communities where we live. Our commitment to sustainability provides a guidepost for our behavior and a lens to measure our performance.Axalta considers a substantive change in operations as any event that can cause a negative impact to the health, safety, environment, reputation, financial, human rights and social issues. The company takes into account the water usage as well as the economic relevance/impact of the operations.
Please provide details as to how your organization defines substantive change in your business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water riskARI defines substantive change to their business to be when more than 10% of turnover of goods is impacted at the corporate level.
Birla Carbon’s production process has generally not changed over a number of years.  Where technological innovations are available we have made process changes to ensure maximum water efficiency utilization.  Through water retention and recycling programs and other conservation measures we do not anticipate substantive changes in our water risks unless there is some significant unforeseen circumstance in a specific geographic location where water resource might become unavailable or substantially increased in cost.  Poor water quality and potential flooding is possible in some of our locations and we have integrated those risks into our Enterprise Risk Management approach.
As an organization, we define a substantive change as one that has a material impact on our business with our determination guided by the definition of materiality under SEC rules and interpretations.

We use the WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool to assess potential substantive changes in our business and operations due to water stress.  HP defines substantive change from water risk in our operations as facilities that are downgraded to either scarce or extremely scarce renewable water supply per person as defined by the WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool.  Our threshold is when a facility moves from sufficient water supply to stressed status.  This applies to all of our operations globally.  We also apply similar methodology to our supply chain.    Based on 2016 facility water risk assessment, we have approximately 33 sites where water risk is high and 90 sites where water risk is ranked medium to high risk.  Many of these sites have been considered water scarce for years and have become our best practice sites for water conservation. As Hewlett Packard Company, we achieved our 2020 goal to reduce freshwater consumption per employee 20% compared to 2010. As HP Inc., we set a new goal to reduce potable water consumption by 15% by 2025 compared to 2015. Through 2016, potable water consumption at HP sites globally decreased by 3% compared to 2015.  Taking into account the separation of Hewlett-Packard Company on November 1, 2015, calculation for all years relates to supply chain, operations, and products and solutions associated with the business units that are now a part of HP Inc.

We use the WBCSD Global Water tool to assess potential substantive changes in our business and operations due to water stress.  HPE defines substantive change from water risk in our operations as facilities that are downgraded to either scarce or extremely scarce renewable water supply per person as defined by the WBSCD Global Water tool.  Our measurement is based on the total renewable water resource per person at a site, as defined by the Water Tool.  Our threshold is when a facility moves from sufficient water supply to stressed.  This applies to all of our operations globally.  We also apply similar methodology to our supply chain.  Based on 2016 facility data, we identified 62 sites that we considered to have scarce or extremely scarce renewable water supply per person. Many of these sites have been considered water scarce for years and have become our best practice sites for water conservation. The majority of these sites are small sites with minimal employee populations and limited potential impact to our company wide operations.

Water availability and water quality is not a concern at this time.
For Quality, it is not important as we process it to achieve the level of purity required for our processes but the amount of processing could be affected.  For Quantity, it is crucial for the cleaning of our products and cooling our equipment.
This would only be triggered if we did not have a ready supply of adequate quantity and quality of water to meet customer product needs.
Water risks do not affect our operations.
Lavergne does not define a substantive change in its business from water risk.

Dell's largest water risk is associated with supply chain disruption caused by climate change and other water hazards. These disruptions could cause loss in revenue from loss of availability and increase in operations costs as alternative suppliers are utilized at greater costs. Much of Dell's water consumption is based around municipal use, so we have historically prioritized focus on water consumption in water stressed regions.
