Water stress in the western U.S. and changing regulations present two opportunities for AEP to benefit from market opportunities.  In the west, trading water rights with farmers may be an effective alternative to finding new sources of water.  It is often more cost effective for a farmer to sell water rights, if only for one year, than to grow crops that may fail.  AEP would benefit from access to necessary water at a lower cost than developing new water sources.  In the east, new regulations are resulting in the closure of many once-thru cooled power plants.  AEP's water withdrawals and consumption will drop dramatically in 2015 greatly reducing the company's exposure to water issues.

Innovative water recycling and delivery systems have reduced costs in operations. For example in Colorado, a â€œwater on demandâ€ system has reduced the impact on the community of hauling water, reduced water usage and reduced costs. By constructing 60+ miles of pipelines, there are 96% fewer trucks on the road and 88% fewer storage tanks.
The increase of water reuse and recycling systems is resulting in improved water efficiency. For example, in Utah a completions system creates temporary staging sites on existing well sites to treat and recycle flow back water, then move it to the next operation for reuse.

Baker Hughes Water Management organization provides water conservation solutions to the oil and gas industry. One solution reuses up to 100% of produced / flowback water in unconventional gas fields in a closed loop. Another involves increasing oil production by shutting off excess water. With some new technologies, water use is virtually eliminated. For example, the VaporFracâ„¢ service uses 95% less water than conventional fracture stimulation techniques by using nitrogen gas to fracture wells.
Baker Hughes supplies water treatment chemicals such as flocculants and clarifiers so that water can be treated to regulatory standards for reuse or discharge.
Slop water treatment in Fluids Environmental Services to recover and clean water from liquid drilling wastes.
Special emphasis is placed on mitigating the environmental risks associated with fracturing chemicals. Our SmartCareâ„¢ system has been in use since 2009 to ensure the use of environmentally preferred products. SmartCare products are screened through an advanced proprietary process. This family of superior chemistry and technology ensures underground source drinking water remains safe during the well life.
Since hydraulic fracturing uses more water than any other phase of drilling or completing a well, our Baker Hughes Water Management team continues to develop technologies and services that conserve fresh water through reuse. In 2014, our water management business treated more than 100 million barrels of produced water, helping customers reuse and recycle the water used in hydraulic fracturing. This eliminates the need to transport water to the site, and from the site for disposal. The reduction in transportation reduces fuel usage and GHG emissions.  The BrineCareâ„¢ solution, introduced in 2014, also enables operators to use produced water in their hydraulic fracturing operations. This reduces their dependence on fresh water, eliminates the need for transportation by truck, and minimizes their disposal requirements.

Addressing issues related to quality of wastewater discharges with concerned stakeholders provides opportunities to positively influence NGOs and consumer attitudes and to improve Carnivalâ€™s image with existing and potential customers for our cruises.
Equipment manufacturers are willing to subsidize the cost of the new equipment when we offer a ship for pilot testing.  Investments and operational costs associated with this testing include the active involvement of shipboard personnel, who track and monitor the results of these tests.
Improvements that result in lower water consumption directly result in reduced quantities of produced waste water and associated reductions in discharges from the ships.
There is a higher operational cost related to enforcing standards that are more stringent than current regulations.  However, such efforts would result in compliance with stringent future regulations without disruption to the ship if it is required to upgrade its current equipment.

CONSOL Energy treats and discharges over 17 billion gallons of coal mining related water annually.  Natural gas production uses large volumes of water to hydraulically fracture horizontal shale gas wells.  We believe these two activities can be mutually combined to the benefit of the company, to gas producers in the region, and to the environment.  This can occur by utilizing treated mine water in combination with freshwater and flowback water used in gas operations to reduce freshwater needs for gas production.
In 2014, CONSOL Energy was certified by the Center for Sustainable Shale Development (CSSD), confirming our conformance with all 15 CSSD standards.

In response to the 2014 California drought, we internally mandated a 20% reduction in water use at our California facilities (voluntary mandate, not required by regulators) and allocated an additional $400,000 USD earmarked for water reduction/reuse initiatives in California. Facilities were asked to brainstorm ways to conserve water at their specific location, and provide the estimated costs associated with the implementation of improved water efficiency measures. These water efficiency and water reduction innovative solutions will lead to an overall cost savings and reduced water withdrawals. Our SIMI and Dunnewood wineries reduced their water usage 39% and 46% respectively in FY15. These significant reductions were achieved through a number of water-saving measures, including irrigating every other day and during a time of day that minimizes evaporation, and, at Dunnewood, installing a system for barrel washing with recycled water.
In addition to improving water use efficiency, costs savings are an added benefit to implementing water use reduction projects and initiatives.

Manufacturing sustainability programs during new program review require the evaluation of new technologies suchas electrolytic softening toincrease cooling tower cyclesof concentration, thus loweringwater consumption.
We have been working to quantify water consumption over the life of a typical light duty vehicle in the U.S. TheGeorgia Institute of Technologyâ€™s Sustainable Design and Manufacturingprogram recently conducted a literature survey to estimate the water footprint of a typical light-duty vehicle in the U.S.
The cost of using water is expected tocontinue to increase in the coming decades. For a manufacturing company like ours, this would mean higher operating costs. Already, in some locations, rate increases from 2000 to 2012 outpaced water reductions, and our costs will continue to rise if we donâ€™t make further improvements. Working on solutions helps us to secure a â€œlicense to operateâ€ in diverse global locations and can enhance our reputation in local communities.

Cooling towers are one of the biggest users of water at our plants. Weâ€™re using new technologies such as electrolytic water softening to increase cooling tower cycles of concentration, thus lowering water consumption.
Ford has installed storm water management systems that help with run-off and provide environmental benefits.
In 2013, the CuautitlÃ¡n, Mexico plant won Fordâ€™s Latin America Environmental Leadership Award for an initiative using ecological concrete. The facility replaced the asphalt and parking lots within the plant with ecological concrete, which allows rain to reenter the ground. This recharges the aquifer beneath the plant and helps prevent water scarcity in the city. The plant renovated an area of more than 9,700 square meters with ecological concrete, allowing the absorption of as much as 7.5 million liters of water per year. Not only was the project beneficial for the community, it was also beneficial for Fordâ€™s own bottom line. Ford facilities in Dearborn and Louisville are now using ecological concrete as well. Ford's strategy is to continue replicating the use of ecological concrete in other locations where feasible.

Goodyear monitors the water stress situation for each of our global facilities and takes appropriate action. In general, as part of Goodyear's strategy to conserve and recycle water, almost all facilities utilize closed-loop cooling systems when water is used for cooling materials and equipment. Systems are also in place to capture and return process water and steam condensate for reuse, reducing the need for additional fresh water.  Cost savings associated with these opportunities is relatively low when compared to the cost saving from other capital expenditures; however, this allows Goodyear to reinvest in future conservation projects. Our plants in Americana, Brazil; Malaysia; and Aurangabad, India have all invested significantly in infrastructure upgrades and onsite wastewater treatment systems to help conserve water and implement cost savings.
Goodyear analyzes the water stress and consumption at each manufacturing facility. These indicators are factored into future plans and capital expenditures to help improve overall water use at each facility. Capital expenditures have included installing closed-loop systems, onsite wastewater treatment systems, and upgrading infrastructure.
Goodyear's corporate mission includes a set of shared values, one of which is to "care for our environment and communities." We believe our long-standing reputation as a responsible corporate citizen helps to increase our brand value, and corporate responsibility is ingrained in our culture.

Adhesives play a significant role in downstream sustainability. We work closely with hundreds of industries and customers to develop adhesive solutions in support of their sustainability goals. Our adhesives enable manufacturers to work with more sustainable substrates, reduce material used, improve efficiencies, and reduce energy consumption and waste.For example, water scarcity is a global issue that is of particular concern to some of our customers. One way to increase clean water supply is to purify alternate sources, and filtration systems that enable purification rely on high performance adhesives. Our NSF-certified adhesives for liquid separation filters provide production benefits, such as reduced assembly cycle times. They also improve all aspects of filter performance, including energy use, longevity, and safety. Our filtration adhesives offer exceptional resistance to chemicals and harsh environmental conditions.We plan to continue to work with our customers to develop innovative solutions to their adhesion needs.

Addressing the global water challenge will require a portfolio of solutions demanding the systems integration expertise that Lockheed Martin currently offers.  Our experience with many customers that are now facing water challenges will be leveraged to address their ongoing and increasing needs related to water, energy and climate change. To realize this opportunity, we are investing in R&D to develop new technologies to mitigate these global water challenges. Once fully developed, these technologies have the potential to be a financially viable solution to address water challenges. According  to SBI Energy's October 2011 report, â€œGlobal Desalination Market Set to Grow 320.3% by 2020â€, the global desalination market is projected to be $52.4 billion by 2020 up 320% from $12.5 billion in 2010. Hypothetically, for every 1% of market share that Lockheed Martin was to capture, it would be worth $524 million in increased revenue according to the market projection for 2020.
Lockheed Martin is investing research and development funds to further the development of renewable energy capabilities for our customers.  To further realize this opportunity, in 2014, we acquired Sun Catalytix to expand on our energy storage technology offerings, which is critical for a robust renewable energy market. We also rebranded one of our business units as â€œSustainability Technologiesâ€ to further demonstrate our commitment to providing leading edge renewable energy technologies.
Lockheed Martin developed the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R) with a mission to improve forecasting quality and timeliness generating significant economic benefits to the nation in the areas of climate monitoring, ecosystems management, commerce and transportation. We continue to pursue space-based opportunities to assist in similar missions.
As part of our Go Green program, Lockheed Martin has established a water reduction target to reduce absolute water use by 25% by 2020 measured from a 2010 baseline.  This program promotes smart water stewardship to improve operational efficiencies. In 2015, we made our target more robust and increased the reduction to 30%. This number will be reflected in next yearâ€™s report.

All of our factories rely on water as an ingredient in our products and for use in our manufacturing processes. Our Sustainable in a Generation (SiG) program and goals aim to minimize the impacts of our operations on the environment, including water impacts, based on the best-available scientific data. Our goals are deliberately challenging - our ambition is to decouple the impacts of our operations from production volumes by pursuing absolute reductions.Our short-term water goal is to reduce usage in our direct operations by 25% by 2015, from 2007 levels. However, we know that water is a local resource and that simply reducing usage everywhere is not the most effective way to limit our impact. We are using the results of our baseline water risk assessment to develop new targets for 2020 for our most water-intensive sites.
Ninety-seven percent of the water used in our value chain is for growing crops. As we develop our sustainable sourcing strategy, we expect to identify a number of agricultural raw materials whose supply chain can be strengthened through better water management.in one example, we are working with basmati rice farmers in Pakistan to introduce alternate wetting anddrying, an irrigation technique that reduceswater and GHG emissions and improves yields, and is considered ground-breaking water management practice in the rice industry. Weâ€™re also taking part in a project led by the Swiss development organization, Helvetas, which aims to improve water efficiency and productivityfor rice growers in Asia. Nearly one thousand Pakistani rice farmers will directly benefit from this initiative, as it has linked them directly to a new value chain. Mars Food is a member of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP), an industry collaboration that will develop a globally applicable set of rice sustainability standards. The SRP is creating 11 socioeconomic and environmental indicators, including water efficiency. Together with rice growers, buyers, producers, processors, retailers, governments and NGOs, weâ€™re sharingbest practices and partnering to improvestandards across the rice industry.

As climate change leads to rising sea levels and increasing extremes in precipitation around the world, there is a corresponding incidence of floods. Microsoft cloud services can provide businesses and governments with IT services that are resilient to local disruptions from flooding. With our geo-redundant datacenters, the likelihood of a significant weather-related disaster shutting down our services is very unlikely. Organizations in flood-affected areas can resume operations as soon as they are able to restore Internet access (or even continue operations without disruption from an alternative site with Internet access).We are investing to deliver cloud solutions across our product lines; two of our most significant services for businesses are Office 365 and Microsoft Azure. Our global cloud service operations are supported by one of the largest physical networks in the world, with several industry certifications including ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and SAS70 Type II. We use geo-replicated customer workloads (keeping multiple copies of workloads in multiple locations) to improve reliability. We have >2,000 people working on cloud infrastructure and >30,000 software engineers involved in cloud-based activities.This opportunity could help us maintain or exceed growth levels for our cloud services (representing at least $7.5B USD or greater in annual revenue in the future).

The aspirational goal of our Positive Water Impact initiative is to make more and/or better water available to the environment and communities where we operate and source. Our work toward this goal also presents opportunities for business and communities within stressed watersheds to develop processes, information, and technology improvements.
The initiatives in which we are engaged with our portfolio of NGO partners provide a transformative opportunity. Our collaboration with global partners is expected to result in greater water availability where it did not previously exist, thereby providing more sustainable access to water for the community, more sustainable solutions to the global water crisis, and more sustainable access to water for our manufacturing operations.
Conserving water is good for our business and the environment wherever we operate. By the end of 2014, we had reduced our water use per unit of production by 23 percent since 2006, already exceeding our target of a 20 percent reduction by the end of  2015 and delivering a cost saving of approximately $17 million in 2014. Our total water use in 2014 fell from 96.9 million cubic meters to 95.9 million cubic meters.
PepsiCo is working with our U.K. farmers to achieve a 50 percent reduction in agricultural carbon emissions of key growers and the water impact of key growers who operate in water-stressed areas by the end of 2015. New varieties, investment in technology such as drip irrigation, and the data and information available through i-crop and Cool Farm Tool technologies provide confidence that our growers will meet this challenging target.
Our ability to achieve our goals is only possible by collaborating with business, academic experts and NGOs. We are actively involved in the UN Global Compactâ€™s CEO Water Mandate, the WBCSD water leadership group, the International Finance Corporationâ€™s  2030 Water Resources Group and the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable. These forums allow us to learn from other companies and share our own experiences across a spectrum of industries, including food and beverage manufacturing, power generation and construction. This also enables us to discuss water-related issues and advance solutions on a pre-competitive basis.

Some of our technology solutions may enable water efficiency and conservation â€“ in utilities distribution and monitoring or home appliances, for example â€“ however, we have not yet quantified this information. In 2013, TI unveiled the Smart Data Concentrator, which can ultimately help power utilities monitor water (as well as energy and gas) supply and demand in real time and identify opportunities for improvement.
In 2015, we will continue to fund capital-improvement projects to further reduce, recycle and reuse water, especially in newly owned facilities. We plan to use our water champions to strategically focus and further increase our water-efficiency efforts. We also plan to do a feasibility study of at least one large, high-impact water-saving project. We will continue efforts to use water efficiently and reduce total water use. Our 2015 absolute reduction goal is to reduce total water use by 4 percent.

To manage this opportunity for cost saving we have an ongoing water reduction program and monitor water withdrawal across the worldwide manufacturing, distribution and R&D facilities of our Technology business against our voluntary water reduction target.   We set a corporate target to reduce absolute water withdrawals by 21% by 2014 against a 2009 baseline. In 2012, we achieved this goal early by reducing withdrawals by 35%. In 2013 and 2014 we sustained this achievement.  We have now set a new corporate target to reduce absolute water withdrawals by 35% by 2020 against a 2010 baseline.We have a number of projects planned for 2014 and beyond to reduce our water use and achieve this target. We estimate that these water efficiency initiatives may also result in financial savings.  For example eliminating once through cooling systems in air compressors at Webster is estimated to have saved the company ~$136,000 per year in water costs and water efficiency projects implemented at Webster between 2010 and 2014 is estimated to have saved the company ~$156,000 per year in water costs
We recognize substantial opportunity in business resumption challenges experienced by others impacted by adverse weather related events through increased demand for our services offerings.  As the frequency of extreme weather events increases, negative weather impacts such as severe changes in precipitation extremes /flooding may be partially offset by revenue opportunities associated with Xeroxâ€™s business continuity services i.e. whereby Xerox Services can keep customers â€œup and runningâ€ after they have been impacted.Increased demand for Xeroxâ€™s business continuity services would result in increased revenue to Xerox.Xeroxâ€™s business services division (which includes Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Document Outsourcing (DO)) is our largest segment, with $10.5B revenue (2014) representing 54% of our total revenues. We expect revenue growth between 2-4% over the next year driven by portfolio management, global expansion, sales investments to acquire new customers and increase our revenue with current customers, additional acquisitions which increase our service capabilities and global footprint and increased demand for business continuity services in part driven by increases in adverse weather related events. Assuming a 2% increase in our business services division equates to a $0.2B increase in revenue. Through ongoing innovation and acquisitions, our target is to increase business services to approximately two-thirds of total revenue by 2017.

Where appropriate and possible, Yahoo uses existing hydropower for electricity to power its data centers. Existing hydropower affords us low-carbon electricity that is also low cost and less vulnerable to the price fluctuations that can result from changes to the cost of fossil fuel for regions that are more dependent upon coal or natural gas. We currently use hydropower in our owned and operated data centers in Quincy, Washington and Lockport, New York to take advantage of this opportunity.
YCC (Yahoo Compute Coop) design for low-water cooling of data centers is a strategy we are using to realize lower water use. Our Yahoo Compute Coop air-cooled data center design uses over 90 percent less water than conventional water- cooled data center design.  Our WUE in our Lockport, New York data center is ,0101.  For roughly 200 hours out of the year during hot and humid conditions, we use a direct evaporative cooling system. Typically the system generates no or minimal wastewater, resulting in savings from both avoided cost of water and avoided cost of wastewater disposal. We estimate the resulting savings to be less than $150K per year at our Lockport facility. Should costs of water and wastewater increase in the future or prove more expensive in other locations, savings will likely increase.

Our Yahoo Compute Coop air-cooled data center design uses over 90 percent less water than conventional water- cooled data center design.  Our WUE in our Lockport, New York data center is ,0101.  For roughly 200 hours out of the year during hot and humid conditions, we use a direct evaporative cooling system. Typically the system generates no or minimal wastewater, resulting in savings from both avoided cost of water and avoided cost of wastewater disposal. We estimate the resulting savings to be less than $150K per year at our Lockport facility. Should costs of water and wastewater increase in the future or prove more expensive in other locations, savings will likely increase.

Anadarko is currently assessing and designing technologies and opportunities to continue to enhance such systems. For example, in four other plays, Anadarko has constructed and continues to enhance water recycling and delivery systems.
Anadarko is currently installing and operating equipment and systems to increase water recycling and anticipates that it will continue to do so into the future. For example, in West Texas a water recycling system has resulted in the reuse of more than 1 million barrels of produced water. In Pennsylvania, we reuse 100% of flowback water recovered from our operations.
As cited by Energy In Depth on its website, the combustion of 1 Bcf of natural gas as a source of fuel creates over 11 million gallons, or nearly 42 megaliters of water as vapour, a volume which is not typically accounted for in the measurement of life cycle water management for the oil and gas industry. Anadarko is working with industry to develop a valid approach to evaluating this aspect of the use of natural gas.
As Apache continues to seek, research, and implement innovative water reuse and recycling technologies, our reliance on competing potable water sources will decrease. This will reduce stakeholder concerns over drilling activity and potable groundwater impacts and lead to higher efficiency.





Smart utilities solutions currently exist as a product we enable, and anticipate that continuing into the next year.For example, AT&T is working with Hydropoint to support water conservation.  Hydropointâ€™s smart irrigation controllers use AT&T technology to give businesses the ability to track weather patterns and adjust their water use. Please see http://www.att.com/Investor/ATT_Annual/2014/att_business_supports_hydropoint_starwood_resorts.html for more information. AT&T is also participating in the U.S. Department of Commerceâ€™s National Institute of Standards and Technologyâ€™s (NIST) Global Smart Cities Challenge. Network ability. The NIST Challenge is helping to showcase the power of wireless networks in powering technology that interconnects utilities, providing  them with real time monitoring and two-way communications on data related to  water pressure, temperature, leak detection and other areas of concern.

We have an opportunity to grow our business through financing investments in mitigating and adapting to climate change, including water. Our water investments focus on innovative new technologies and infrastructure development, including water purification.
The need for adaptation presents opportunities for financial institutions to provide financing solutions to public agencies, commercial clients and residential customers, enabling them to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change. We see particular opportunities for our business in the issuance of climate or green bonds: financing tools for raising debt capital for climate change mitigation or adaptation-related projects or programs. Green bonds were created to increase funding by accessing the $80 trillion bond market and expanding the investor base for climate-mitigation or adaptation projects worldwide. They are fixed income, liquid financial instruments and the funds green bonds raise are dedicated to climate-mitigation and adaption projects, and other environmentally beneficial activities. The impacts of climate change on water resources will be a critical focus for adaptation efforts. Globally, 45% of projected 2050 GDP is at risk and as many as 50 countries are potential locations for conflicts over water. Aging infrastructure compounds the problem; according to the US Conference of Mayors, the US needs as much as $4.8 trillion in water and wastewater investment over the next 20 years. There is a range of ways in which our financing and advisory services can be put to use in this area, and this has become a significant focus for our Environmental, Social and Governance and sustainability research team.
This is a strategic evaluation for us as much of the water used for ore processing is recycled or reused at our operations. In 2014, 59% of Barrick operations were zero discharge sites with all water recycled and reused. The remaining 41%, mostly located in wet climates, released treated water to the environment. Sites which are operated as zero discharge reuse all water that potentially come in contact with the mine disturbed areas. This removes the cost to construct and operate additional water extraction or water treatment facilities for discharge. For example, Barrickâ€™s Veladero mine in Argentina has become a zero discharge facility since 2013 by recycling treated domestic wastewater for operational water usage.
Develop new technologies to incorporate sea water into processing.
Increased cost for water as a result of constrained availability makes capital investments in water conservation methods(or projects with a longer ROI) more feasible and save more money over the lifetime of the project.   With support from management we are making changes to investment guidelines related to sustainability related projects. This will accelerate investment in projects which reduce energy consumption and water.

A key focus of our newly formed Operations Technology and Innovation Group is driving manufacturing innovation that has the potential to dramatically multiply our drug throughput and increase our manufacturing capacity with little or no increase in the amount of natural resources used. For example, the process of separating components of mixtures is known as chromatography. Cells in our bioreactors create byproducts that require water to purify. We are using technologies that allow us to run chromatography at higher concentrations, which significantly decreases our water use at this stage of production. This not only cuts down on our water use, but also reduces the energy required to move and purify the large amounts of water it takes to create safe, high quality biopharmaceutical products.
Biogen consumes a substantial amount of potable water each year for heat rejection, largely through evaporative losses at cooling towers. The major Biogen sites can eliminate evaporative potable water consumption associated with cooling towers by implementing the following technologies: Adiabatic Coolers and Hybrid Cooling Towers (RTP), Ground Water System (HillerÃ¸d), Dry-Coolers (Cambridge).
Conducted groundwater feasibility study at HillerÃ¸d site to evaluate potential for a closed loop HVAC cooling system.
Conducting water audits at 3 main campuses to identify opportunities for conservation.

For example, the process of separating components of mixtures is known as chromatography. Cells in our bioreactors create byproducts that require water to purify. We are using technologies that allow us to run chromatography at higher concentrations, which significantly decreases our water use at this stage of production. This not only cuts down on our water use, but also reduces the energy required to move and purify the large amounts of water it takes to create safe, high quality biopharmaceutical products.
Biogen consumes a substantial amount of potable water each year for heat rejection, largely through evaporative losses at cooling towers. The major Biogen sites can eliminate evaporative potable water consumption associated with cooling towers by implementing the following technologies: Adiabatic Coolers and Hybrid Cooling Towers (RTP), Ground Water System (HillerÃ¸d), Dry-Coolers (Cambridge).
Conducted groundwater feasibility study at HillerÃ¸d site to evaluate potential for a closed loop HVAC cooling system.

In areas of greater water risk, Brown-Forman continues to develop projects which will ultimately lower our water consumption and wastewater discharge, giving us an advantage over our competitors who may lack such efficiency.Brown-Formanâ€™s water conservation and efficiency efforts have reduced costs directly by purchasing less water. In this reporting year alone, we reduced water withdrawals by over 68 million gallons.  We estimate cost savings associated with this reduction to be a moderate decrease in our global operating costs.

Global trade in grains and oilseeds is expected to double from 300 to 600 million metric tons by 2050.  This increase will be driven in part by an increase in the trade of â€œvirtualâ€ waterâ€”water embedded in products such as agricultural commodities.   Bungeâ€™s diverse, global operations enable it both to promote and benefit from virtual water trade by supplying regions with water-intensive crops that cannot be efficiently produced locally.
Near-term dislocations in global agricultural trade flows due to climate or water related impacts on agricultural production and commodity availability present opportunities for Bunge to leverage its global asset network to serve customers and meet demand in times of shortage.
One of the opportunities has been the development of goals.  We currently have a goal to reduce our water use by 50% by 2020.  We have also committed to reducing water use in our top 5 agricultural ingredients by 20%.  These goals have led us to develop more efficient processes.
We believe in the importance of stakeholder engagement and it is part of our overall CSR and environmental strategy.  Understanding water risks and having strategies in place to mitigate such risks can help  with these stakeholder relationships.
Having a goal helps us to embed sustainability throughout and triggers water efficiency projects, which often results in a cost savings.  In addition, this often triggers innovation.

Cisco is currently investigating how to reduce its water consumption at its campus in San Jose, California. Although most water fixtures were replaced with more water efficient options within the last 5 years, we believe there are still opportunities that exist today to cost-effectively reduce our water consumption at the campus. Over the next year, Cisco's facilities' team will be evaluating all of our existing water fixtures in sinks, bathrooms and cafeterias to determine exactly which fixtures could be replaced with more efficient options.  The team will also be turning off the campuses' last water fountains and converting them into planter beds with native, drought-resistant plants. This initiative will help Cisco reduce water, energy and maintenance costs on the order of $100,000 USD per year.

We have reduced our water consumption company-wide by 14% (per case of product sold) from 2008 to 2011. In 2012, we set a new goal to further reduce our water consumption by 20% per case of product sold by 2020 vs. 2011 base year. Three years into this new goal period, we have already reduced water consumption by 11% vs. this new goal (in addition to the 14% reduction achieved previously).  In 2012, we converted our namesake bleach to a 33% more concentrated formula. It also helps reduce our water footprint since it is 33% more concentrated and makes for more efficient distribution.

We will continue to investigate and implement strategies for reducing water use while continuing to produce brands of the highest quality. We will also continue to manage water risk as part of our business strategy. This is not only true of our operations in California â€“ we are actively managing and reducing our use of water at our facilities worldwide. For example, our brewery in Nava, Mexico reuses 30% of its incoming water and has a leading water efficiency rate of 3.49 liters of water/liter of product. Not only does responsible water use conserve valuable resources, but it also results in operational cost savings. Our internal mandate helped the California facilities reduced their water use collectively by 11%. We will continue to review our production facility water reduction targets annually.
Improved water use efficiency can reduce costs (e.g. reduced pumping, reduced treatment volumes, etc.) at production facilities while also resulting in positive environmental impacts.
We will continue our engagement in local, regional, and international community water programs such as Sustainable Winegrowing New Zealand, the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance, and Fish Friendly Farming, which help us improve our water use efficiency, and reduce our impact on local water resources while increasing brand reputation.

The new technologies save water and are targeted at locations with water stress and risk issues. Our Powertrain and Vehicle Operations divisions have developed tools which evaluate the environmental impacts of new engine, transmission, and vehicleprograms, and determine theoptimum investments to achieve environmental improvement. These toolsexamine the impact of the newprogram on many different environmental media, including water.
The analysis that Ford conducted included water used in material production, production of parts, assembly, use, and disposal at end-of life.  In the supply chain, the production and processing of metals (in particular steel and aluminum) require the most water. Identifying which portions of the supply chain are most water-intensive allows us to better assess the business risk associated with using different suppliers in potentially water stressed areas.  Information on this analysis appears in Ford's Sustainability Report and is used to inform our efforts with suppliers.
Our work on developing new technologies for water stressed areas can be leveraged so save money in other locations. These operations become more viable as the cost of water increases.  Improving water efficiency within our operations reduces usage and wastewater generated, thereby saving the company money.
This technology enables consolidation of painting activities in an integrated booth, offering the potential to eliminate one booth water wash section, depending on plant design.  3-Wet is being replicated at Ford plants around the globe, including facilities in North America and Asia Pacific.
This system eliminates water usage from the painting process, resulting in an 80 percent water savings for air conditioning/air tempering and 100 percent water savings from paint-over-spray separation, based on production volume of 158,000 units per year.
MQL uses an extremely small amount of oil versus conventional wet-machining. For a typical production line of 450,000 vehicles, MQL can save 282,000 gallons of water per year.  This technology is being replicated at Ford powertrain plants around the globe.
We are increasing usage of internal water metering to identify additional water saving opportunities, better control water usage by functional area and drive conservation behaviors to the department level.
Ford is pilot testing ways to save water at our cooling towers, which are one of the biggest water users at our plants. Weâ€™re trying new technologies that soften the water so that there are fewer salts to cause equipment scaling. This allows us to reuse the water through the cooling towers many more times before the hardness requires us to bring freshwater in, reducing the amount of freshwater needed for cooling processes and comfort cooling. This technology is being replicated at Ford plants across the globe.
In 2014, we are marking the 10th anniversary of the rebuilt Dearborn Truck Plant, which was hailed as a model of sustainable manufacturing when we rebuilt it in 2004. The facility incorporates stormwater management systems designed to emulate a natural system, including what was then the largest green roof in the world.  Louisville Assembly Plant installed porous pavers for their employee parking lot, which helps with storm water management. The plant received Ford's US/Canada Environmental Leadership Award for this project. Ford's Cuautitlan, Mexico Assembly plant has implemented ecological concrete as well. Additional details are provided below.
 Ecological concrete is less expensive than traditional concrete and is maintenance-free. As a result, this has saved the plant approximately $40,000 a year in maintenance costs.
We have created a Women + Water strategy that targets areas with the greatest impacts on womenâ€™s well-being and the use of water in our supply chain.  Key components of the Women + Water strategy include: 1. Developing environmental performance standards and sharing best sustainability practices among strategic fabric mills;2. Providing education on good water practices and access to clean water to women and communities through the Gap Inc. P.A.C.E. Program; 3. Improving product sustainability.By finding innovative ways to respond to water challenges, we have an opportunity to help support workersâ€™ well-being and contribution to our business.  In the process, we can enhance our license to operate in sourcing countries and communities, which have potential to become future markets for our products.
Gap Inc. was the first retailer to execute a large-scale rollout of the Sustainable Apparel Coalitionâ€™s (SAC) Higg Index 2.0 tool to assess our suppliers' environmental impact.  We began working with a targeted group of seven vendors (approximately 50 facilities) in India to benchmark their water use in 2014.  The results quickly highlighted facilities with the best water management practices, which we shared anonymously with other participating facilities.  We have since scaled up our roll-out, and have now received environmental assessments from approximately 33% of our supplier base, covering 73% of the factories where our clothes are made.To best utilize this information, we created an online data dashboard all of our suppliers can access.  The dashboard breaks down supplier greenhouse gas, energy and water consumption by country and factory, and identifies key areas for impact reduction at a country level. This information helps them understand how their performance compares to competitors and peers and encourages them to take new measures to reduce their environmental impacts.
There are reputational opportunities for those companies adequately managing water risk. Additionally, cost savings in the form of energy savings (pumping, heating) are accrued as we are more efficient with water. See document attached under Linkage section. Assuring that suppliers have sufficient water to produce the ingredients we need will provide supply chain resilience.

Process cooling water at our Seminole Gas Processing Plant in West Texas is our largest freshwater use. Water is sourced from a Hess- owned and operated well field. Due to low humidity and hot temperatures, there is high evaporative loss. We conducted a feasibility study and are conducting a limited hydrogeologic assessment to evaluate water use and explore future conservation measures.

A pilot study in North Dakota tested the technical and economic feasibility of using brackish groundwater for hydraulic fracturing and well maintenance. In pilot wells, 14 percent of the frac fluid freshwater volume was replaced by brackish water. We also tested the viability of using treated sanitary wastewater from the crew camps that house our workers. Though technically suitable the volume is presently insufficient for frac applications.

Better water management will become increasingly important throughout the economy as climate change and regulatory responses drive reduced water availability or increased water costs. This creates opportunity for our newer and more energy efficient product lines (due to the energy-water nexus), as well as innovative products designed to help consumers and businesses better manage their water use. Our Internet of Things Group, for example, which deals in segments such as smart buildings, transportation, agricultural applications, and manufacturing and energy, had a net revenue of $2.1 billion in 2014, growing 19% compared to 2013.


     We manage opportunities to invest in water efficiency.  First, we actively work to identify regions that are exposed to current and projected risks, and we analyze our current and future water scarcity risks using tools such as the WRI Aqueduct risk tool.  We have determined that approximately 30% of our sites are located in areas that  met the criteria for "water-stressed" in 2014.  Then, we set meaningful goals to reduce our water consumption, focusing on these water-stressed areas.       For example, to achieve our Health Future 2015 goal to decrease absolute water consumption by 10%, we have implemented a number of water reduction efforts: water audits, mandatory water conservation plans, and increased use of recycled water.  Another example would be the series of chilled water system optimization projects that will be done in the next several years.  They will reduce water consumption by over 23 million gallons; they will also have a positive impact on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.

Performance contracting is basically receiving a guaranteed energy and water savings to offset facility and infrastructure renewal project costs. It allows customers to make capital improvements, save energy and water, reduce emissions, improve sustainability and address tight budgets â€“ and use the expected utility and operational savings to offset the cost of the upgrades.  The savings are guaranteed, so risks to the customer are minimal.
AMR/AMI from Johnson Controls can help improve cash flow, reduce water losses, protect property, preserve system capacity and cut operating costs by avoiding:  system leaks, leaks at customer sites, damaged or broken meters, and tampering/theft issues.
Buildings account for the use of 40% of all energy, 68% of electricity and 88% of all potable water throughout the world, so there are significant opportunities to help customers save both water and energy.
Our corporate campus was awarded LEEDÂ® Platinum certification.  The 33-acre site showcases our energy-efficient and sustainable building products and services. Since the renovation, energy usage has been reduced significantly, despite the doubling of office space by over 160,000 square feet.
For example, our the York test lab established a team to identify, quantify and assign value for possible water savings opportunities when testing chillers for leaks using water. Ways to recycled the test water were identified resulting in an annual of about 456,600 gallons.
We use the latest technologies to reduce energy and water use and use systems such as our PanoptixÂ® Carbon & Energy Reporter software to calculate GHG emissions, energy, water, and waste. Our Best Business Practice/Continuous Improvement (BBP/CI) management system uses these data to identify and manage improvement projects across the enterprise.

NRG acquired a 25.65 MW solar project on the Island of Guam from Quantum Guam Power Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned affiliate of Quantum Utility Generation LLC.To help alleviate the Pacific island from the volatility of unpredictable fuel prices and availability, we will construct, own and operate the solar project, which will sell all of its power output to the Guam Power Authority (GPA). We will relieve the island of its dependency on imported residual fuel oil and diesel for its power. Estimates for the project predict that the solar solution will offset the consumption of almost 2 million barrels of residual fuel oil and diesel â€“ minimizing Guam's carbon footprint.

In South Africa many mining operations are located in remote mountainous settings and can benefit from a microgrid solution in much the same way as a tropical island. Another proof point is reliability. For countries where grid performance is an issue with serious bottom-line impact, the ability of a company or community to take control of its energy needs through a microgrid or solar array can be reason enough to install this type of approach. In simple terms, a non-traditional solution delivering traditional benefits. This real-world applicability of renewable energy has become its most meaningful message. As energy costs get scrutinized along with every budget item, they provide an ever-present motivator for companies to look at proven renewable approaches to reduce costs, gain control and increase profits.

In South Africa many mining operations are located in remote mountainous settings and can benefit from a microgrid solution in much the same way as a tropical island. Another proof point is reliability. For countries where grid performance is an issue with serious bottom-line impact, the ability of a company or community to take control of its energy needs through a microgrid or solar array can be reason enough to install this type of approach.

Conserving water is good for our business and the environment wherever we operate. By the end of 2014, we had reduced our water use per unit of production by 23 percent since 2006, already exceeding our target of a 20 percent reduction by the end of  2015 and delivering a cost saving of approximately $17 million in 2014. Our total water use in 2014 fell from 96.9 million cubic meters to 95.9 million cubic meters.
PepsiCo is working with our U.K. farmers to achieve a 50 percent reduction in agricultural carbon emissions of key growers and the water impact of key growers who operate in water-stressed areas by the end of 2015. New varieties, investment in technology such as drip irrigation, and the data and information available through i-crop and Cool Farm Tool technologies provide confidence that our growers will meet this challenging target.
Our ability to achieve our goals is only possible by collaborating with business, academic experts and NGOs. We are actively involved in the UN Global Compactâ€™s CEO Water Mandate, the WBCSD water leadership group, the International Finance Corporationâ€™s  2030 Water Resources Group and the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable. These forums allow us to learn from other companies and share our own experiences across a spectrum of industries, including food and beverage manufacturing, power generation and construction. This also enables us to discuss water-related issues and advance solutions on a pre-competitive basis.

In California, utilities receive financial incentives for the successful implementation of energy-efficiency programs.  In many cases energy reduction efforts reduce water use as well, through energy and water-efficient appliances and equipment. To the extent our customers become more focused on reducing energy and water use, this provides our California utilities with more opportunities to provide these resources and earn financial incentives, as available.
Sempra has taken many steps to minimize water use in our operations. This includes using reclaimed water and dry-cooling at our power plants and photovoltaic cells made that convert sunlight directly into electricity without the use of water. As water becomes an increasingly scarce resource and Sempra and its business units are recognized for taking action to reduce water use, this can positively impact our reputation, making it easier to do business and get new projects permitted and approved.
Our SDG&E and SoCalGas business units are reducing water use at employee-occupied facilities through equipment upgrades, in addition to water-saving measures for landscaping, including drought-tolerant plants and weather-based irrigation. We also utilize water-saving technologies for power generation, including photovoltaic cells that generate electricity from sunlight without using water.  When we save water, we also reduce energy use, further reducing costs and impacts to the environment.

The manufacturing of glass containers is not seen as being very sensitive to climate change. For example: We use abundant raw materials (including a lot of recycled glass), are not large users of water, are generally not affected by adverse weather conditions, and are the only material that can be widely refilled. This could translate to increased differentiation among the competition if significant climate changes occur.

Our patented blowdown boilers increase water recycling and we are building them into our facilities. We continue to implement Wedge Wellâ„¢ technology, allowing us to recover more oil with little extra water. In 2014, we expanded our Ultra High Quality Steam process, an innovation to make steam production more efficient. Our SkyStratâ„¢ drilling rig is heliportable, eliminating ice roads and uses less water in drilling operations.
To ensure we are meeting our regulatory requirements around water use in our drilling and exploration programs, we developed and rolled out an innovative new system for tracking our water withdrawals by source and end use. We developed a video to train field staff and water haulers on the new system.
We started reusing clean effluent from our camps wastewater treatment facility to build ice roads and as dust suppression water. We are now using saline groundwater rather than using fresh surface water from Lake Newell in our conventional operations.
In our oil sands operations, the steam to oil ratio (or SOR) is an indicator that highlights the water use and energy required. A lower SOR means lower energy use, fewer emissions, lower costs and less water use. We use it as a benchmark of efficiency in our oil sands operations. Cenovus continues to have one of the lowest SORs in our industry. Our low SOR allows us to produce with low energy requirements, low water use and low operating costs.


By installing these features, we are attempting to control water consumption. As an example, by having hands-free (sensor) faucets installed we are eliminating the potential of having faucets run for longer than needed, thus reducing water consumption

PROVIDING GOODS AND SERVICES THAT ENABLE OTHERS TO ADAPT TO PHYSICAL CHANGES, GROWING POPULATIONS AND WATER DEMAND: With population and economic growth mounting in areas of water scarcity, the demand for specialized water well drilling is increasing.  Our water management services enable Layne Christensen to help bring water to areas of the world that need it most. Our Water Resource Divisionâ€™s Layne Hydro group provides drought-planning services.
CHANGING RAINFALL PATTERNS MAY INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR FLOOD DEFENSES AND STORMWATER SYSTEMS IN SOME AREAS:  Our Heavy Civil and Water Resources divisions provide water infrastructure services that provide, protect and repair water systems following hurricanes
HELPING CUSTOMERS MEET WATER REGULATION REQUIREMENTS:Relative to the drinking water market, regulatory changes in the United States will drive demand for Layne Christensenâ€™s products and services. THMs, organic chemicals that occur in drinking water as a result of chlorine disinfectant treatment, are currently regulated with a maximum contaminant level.
INCREASING OUR OWN WATER STEWARDSHIP WITHIN OPERATIONS AND SERVICE DELIVERY: Increasing our awareness of the ways in which we use and dispose of water will help us to better manage our overall environmental footprint and reduce costs.
DEMAND FOR WATER RECYCLING, RE-USE, CONSERVATION, SPECIALIZED TREATMENT AND FILTRATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES: For municipalities and water districts seek to upgrade aging facilities or meet increasingly stringent regulations, Layne provides low-waste treatment equipment, membrane bioreactor systems for re-use and treatment capabilities for use of marginal quality water supplies. Deep injection technology also presents an opportunity for Layne Christensen to utilize our historic drilling competencies to complement our wastewater treatment activities.
ADAPTATION, RESILIENCY AND CONTINUED INNOVATION: We anticipate two key areas in which Layne Christensen can respond to water scarcity challenges: (1) the development of alternative water supplies for industrial applications, and (2) the desalination of seawater. Developing a deeper understanding of the industrial water and wastewater sectorâ€™s sustainability challenges and needs will help position Layne as a leader in this space.

Water stress in the western U.S. and changing regulations present two opportunities for AEP to benefit from market opportunities.  In the west, trading water rights with farmers may be an effective alternative to finding new sources of water.  It is often more cost effective for a farmer to sell water rights, if only for one year, than to grow crops that may fail.  AEP would benefit from access to necessary water at a lower cost than developing new water sources.  In the east, new regulations are resulting in the closure of many once-thru cooled power plants.  AEP's water withdrawals and consumption have dropped dramatically during 2015 greatly reducing the company's exposure to water issues.

We developed water maps for each of our sites, following the flow of water through the site to its exit point. Through these evaluations we are able to characterize all points of water use, identify significant water users, and develop performance indicators. These water maps are already providing opportunities and benefits.

Innovative water recycling and delivery systems have reduced costs in operations. For example in Colorado, a â€œwater on demandâ€ system has reduced the impact on the community of trucking water, reduced water usage and reduced costs. By constructing 60+ miles (FYI - OVER 150 miles in Colorado alone) of pipelines, there are 96% fewer trucks on the road and 88% fewer storage tanks.
The increase of water reuse and recycling systems is resulting in improved water efficiency. For example, in Utah, a completions system creates temporary staging sites on existing well sites to treat and recycle flow back water, then move it to the next operation for reuse.
Improving the ability of the oil and natural gas industry to account for total lifecycle water use and generation, through enhanced water measurement. Anadarko has a water technical team currently working on developing a company-wide enhanced water-measurement program.

We have opportunities in the issuance of climate or green bonds: financing tools for raising debt capital for climate change mitigation or adaptation-related projects or programs.Our strategy to realize this opportunity is to expand the green bond market. Since green bonds first came onto the market nearly a decade ago, we have been a leader in developing the market through collaborating with peers, being the lead underwriter, and directly issuing $1.1 billion in green bonds.  In 2014 and 2015, we were the number one underwriter of green bond issuances.This strategy is being implemented through our extensive involvement in thought leadership around new adaptation finance approaches. We are participating in the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance that has co-developed new adaptation solutions aimed at increasing resilience in agricultural supply-chains. We serve as one of the two designated active private sector observers to the Board of the new Green Climate Fund that has a mandate to deploy finance for adaptation that can mobilize private capital.An example of this implementation is that in 2015, we served as a lead bookrunner for the District of Columbia Water & Sewer Authority ($100 million) to finance a portion of the DC Clean Rivers Project.We estimate the potential implication of this opportunity to be over $10 billion of annual business activity for our company, across climate mitigation and adaptation bond issuances.
We have an opportunity to grow our business through financing investments in mitigating and adapting to climate change, including water. In 2015, we pledged to increase the companyâ€™s current environmental business initiativefrom $50 billion to $125 billion by 2025 to address climate change and demands on natural resources throughlending, investing, capital raising, advisory services, and developing financing solutions for clients around the world. This initiative emphasizes energy efficiency, renewable energy, transportation, waste and water. Since we launched our goal in 2013, weâ€™ve provided more than $31.8 billion in financing for low-carbon and other sustainable business. In 2015 alone, we delivered $14.5 billion toward this goal, including $575 million towards water-related projects. Our water investments focus on innovative new technologies and infrastructure development, including water purification. We also provide industry-leading research and advisory services to help inform our clients who are looking to invest in products and services that address water scarcity, water quality, and other water-related issues.

Reduced capital and operating costs by increasing the use of recycled water onsite instead of discharging it, thereby reducing water treatment requirements, water withdrawals and associated costs. In 2015, six Barrick operations were zero discharge sites with all water recycled and reused. The remaining 50%, mostly located in wet climates, released treated water to the environment. Sites which are operated as zero discharge reuse all water that potentially come in contact with the mine disturbed areas. This removes the cost to construct and operate additional water extraction or water treatment facilities for discharge. For example, Barrickâ€™s Veladero mine in Argentina has become a zero discharge facility since 2013 by recycling treated domestic wastewater for operational water usage.
Continue to invest in R&D of new technologies using alternative water sources for metal extraction processing with the objective to reduce the need for capital and operational costs for water treatment and water supply.  This will position Barrick to be a leader in mineral processing technologies
The opportunity to increase capital availability is currently being re-evaluated because of proven savings from energy conservation and buying strategies implemented in since 2008 to reach our 2015 Sustainability Targets (one of which is around water reduction)  In 2014, we developed a modified capital investment strategy to include a relaxed ROI criteria for sustainability projects

Addressing issues related to quality of wastewater discharges with concerned stakeholders provides opportunities to positively influence NGOs and consumer attitudes and to improve Carnivalâ€™s image with existing and potential customers for our cruises.
Equipment manufacturers are willing to subsidize the cost of the new equipment when we offer a ship for pilot testing.  Investments and operational costs associated with this testing include the active involvement of shipboard personnel, who track and monitor the results of these tests.
Improvements that result in lower water consumption directly result in reduced quantities of produced waste water and associated reductions in discharges from the ships.
There is a higher operational cost related to enforcing standards that are more stringent than current regulations.  However, such efforts would result in compliance with stringent future regulations without disruption to the ship if it is required to upgrade its current equipment.

The concentration of our products (removal of water from our products without any formulation changes) makes us less dependent on water as a manufacturing input into our supply chain. This would put Clorox at a competitive advantage vs. others who might be more dependent on the availability of water. We invest in capital and infrastructure to promote water efficiency. Capital investments fund projects to help us reach our 2020 water reduction goals. We also improve efficiency through engaging our employees in conserving water.
Cloroxâ€™s commitment to provide bleach and other key disinfecting products to populations in areas where natural disasters have occurred is very critical to the general health and well-being of people in these areas, particularly bleach donations that support the disinfection of microbiologically contaminated water supplies that often occur following natural disasters. In addition, the company has been supporting the Clorox Safe Water Project in rural Peru since 2012, partnering with a local NGO to implement a bleach-based intervention to treat microbiologically unsafe drinking water on an ongoing basis.  These public health interventions also provide the Clorox Company reputational value. In addition, we set public sustainability goals which include water reduction and share these goals through our annual report and on our public Corporate Responsibility website. Sharing these goals, which include water reduction, enhances our brand value by demonstrating to our consumers that sustainability is a key business initiative.
We have conducted water audit workshops globally to enable our manufacturing locations to get more efficient in the way they use process water, and recycle and re-use water where possible.

CONSOL Energy treats and discharges over 14 billion gallons of coal mining influenced water annually.  Natural gas production uses large volumes of water to hydraulically fracture horizontal shale gas wells.  We believe these two activities can be mutually combined to the benefit of the company, to gas producers in the region, and to the environment.  This can occur by utilizing treated mine water in combination with freshwater and flowback water used in gas operations to reduce freshwater needs for gas production.
In 2014, CONSOL Energy was certified for the first time by the Center for Sustainable Shale Development (CSSD), confirming our conformance with all 15 CSSD standards.  CONSOL Energy has shown that in 15 critical areas, its Appalachian Basin operations meet or exceed state and federal air and water management regulatory requirements.  In 2015, CONSOL underwent an annual recertification audit to measure our ongoing conformance to the CSSD standards.  More details regarding CSSD can be found at www.sustainableshale.org.

Facility specific water use ratio intensity metrics are shared internally to promote internal competition. Facilities are asked to brainstorm ways to conserve water at their specific location, and provide the estimated costs associated with the implementation of improved water efficiency measures. We understand that water reductions initiatives are not one size fits all. And we also understand that these water efficiency and water reduction innovative solutions will lead to an overall cost savings and reduced water withdrawals. With focus on the drought in California, urban water users achieved reduced water withdrawals through a few ways. One example of an initiative was the installation of a glycol heat exchange which replaced a water-intensive heat exchange unit at a California facility. Water reductions were also achieved through the utilization of recycled process water.
In addition to improving water use efficiency, costs savings are an added benefit to implementing water use reduction projects and initiatives. We are working to implement water efficiency projects at each of our facilities, with a heightened focus at our California locations that have experienced a drought in recent years.

Water Efficient Generation: Decisions regarding generation type can influence water use and demand. Where feasible and appropriate, there is a potential opportunity to explore the use of water efficient or low water intensity generation such as simple gas combustion turbines, combined-cycle gas facilities, solar photovoltaic installations, fuel cell installation, and wind generation. In general, these types of generation present opportunities to use less water.
There is a potential opportunity to reuse, reclaim, or recycle water used in the generation of electricity. For example, some facilities may have opportunities to reclaim municipal wastewater where available, feasible, and appropriate. Additionally, stormwater collection and harvesting may also serve as an opportunity to use alternative water supplies.

During our completions, operations large volumes of fresh water are used.  Often the water is only used once, as the costs of moving water to the next job location and storing water until needed are greater than cost of disposing water and sourcing new fresh water.  Our completions projects are now planned to occur back to back, so that the water can be used at next site without the need to store water.  This saves approximately $30K storage cost per location.

Manufacturing sustainability programs during new program review require the evaluation of new technologies suchas electrolytic softening toincrease cooling tower cyclesof concentration, thus loweringwater consumption.
We have been working to quantify water consumption over the life of a typical light duty vehicle in the U.S. TheGeorgia Institute of Technologyâ€™s Sustainable Design and Manufacturingprogram recently conducted a literature survey to estimate the water footprint of a typical light-duty vehicle in the U.S.
The cost of using water is expected tocontinue to increase in the coming decades. For a manufacturing company like ours, this would mean higher operating costs. Already, in some locations, rate increases from 2000 to 2012 outpaced water reductions, and our costs will continue to rise if we donâ€™t make further improvements. Working on solutions helps us to secure a â€œlicense to operateâ€ in diverse global locations and can enhance our reputation in local communities.
3-Wet Paint Technology saves water in the painting process at new paint shop installations, which can be heavy water users.
Dry Paint Overspray System saves water in the painting process, which can be a heavy water user.
Ford utilizes a Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) process for machining in certain processes. This saves a substantial amount of water.
Increase usage of internal water metering to help identify areas where there can be cost savings associated with a reduction in water usage.
Cooling towers are one of the biggest users of water at our plants. Weâ€™re using new technologies such as electrolytic water softening to increase cooling tower cycles of concentration, thus lowering water consumption.
Ford has installed storm water management systems that help with run-off and provide environmental benefits.
In 2013, the CuautitlÃ¡n, Mexico plant won Fordâ€™s Latin America Environmental Leadership Award for an initiative using ecological concrete. The facility replaced the asphalt and parking lots within the plant with ecological concrete, which allows rain to reenter the ground. This recharges the aquifer beneath the plant and helps prevent water scarcity in the city. The plant renovated an area of more than 9,700 square meters with ecological concrete, allowing the absorption of as much as 7.5 million liters of water per year. Not only was the project beneficial for the community, it was also beneficial for Fordâ€™s own bottom line. Ford facilities in Dearborn and Louisville are now using ecological concrete as well. Ford's strategy is to continue replicating the use of ecological concrete in other locations where feasible.

Contribute to improving health and well-being for the women who make our clothes and live in communities in our sourcing countries by providing training on good water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices in factory and community settings. We believe this can also benefit suppliers and our business by helping to reduce absenteeism and turnover and improve productivity. We developed and integrated a W.A.S.H. curriculum to our P.A.C.E. (Personal Advancement and Career Enhancement) program for advancing women. The program teaches good practices for water usage, sanitation and hygiene that are intended to improve the health, well-being and productivity of women participants, while also providing spillover benefits to their families and communities. P.A.C.E. helps women in garment factories and communities advance through life and job skills training. In 2015, we announced our new goal to expand P.A.C.E. to reach one million in factory and community settings by 2020.

Enhance our social license to operate and build good relations with stakeholders by provide access to clean, safe water to people living in rural villages in India. We have supported the construction of six water filtration plants through our partnership with Swasti, Health Resource Centre. Six plants currently in operation already serve more than 28,000 people across 52 villages in India. The people who use the water from these plants report that they feel better physically â€“ with fewer ailments like headaches, joint pain and diarrhea â€“ and they also save time because the plants are a short distance from their homes.

Improve the resilience of our supply chain, reduce costs and gain competitive advantage by helping strategic suppliers to adopt more sustainable production technologies and processes. Suppliers who are investing in low-water or even waterless techniques will have an advantage if water becomes less available, more polluted, or unpredictably regulated. This is particularly applicable to our Applicable to our biggest mill and laundry countries: China, India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh. We are promoting the adoption of best practices and new technologies that enable mills and laundries to more sustainably manage their inputs and outputs by improving water quality, efficiency and conservation. For example, our Athleta brand is already using Drydye, a waterless dyeing technique that uses super-critical CO2 in place of water to dye fabric. Eventually, this could even include shifting to entirely closed-loop or Zero Liquid Discharge systems (we identified 2 ZLD facilities so far through assessments at strategic fabric mills).

GEâ€™s strategy to realize this opportunity is carried out through the Water & Process Technologies business, which provides technologies that conserve, clean, recycle and reuse water, and make more water available. For example, our portfolio allows for municipalities and industrial customers to reuse wastewater for additional purposes, such as agricultural and landscape irrigation, groundwater recharge, and other non-potable uses such as heating and cooling. This can further reduce the amount of freshwater required. We are constantly enhancing current products, and we are developing new, even more advanced technologies to help meet water use challenges. Recently, GE Water published a renewed white paper to provide an updated menu of policy options, drawing on examples from around the world, and to provide a valuable starting point for governments to evaluate the appropriate mix of policies that will best fit their needs. Since industrial use is a large part of freshwater consumption, we help our industrial customers solve their greatest water and process challenges, with a focus on providing products and services for the most tough-to-treat situations. An example of our effort to drive innovation in water management is the 2014 GE-Saudi Aramco Ecomagination Challenge: four UD$50,000 cash prizes, funding projects to find innovative solutions that provide measurable, scalable, and economically viable improvements in the process of seawater desalination.

Goodyear monitors the water stress situation for each of our global facilities and takes appropriate action. In general, as part of Goodyear's strategy to conserve and recycle water, almost all facilities utilize closed-loop cooling systems when water is used for cooling materials and equipment. Systems are also in place to capture and return process water and steam condensate for reuse, reducing the need for additional fresh water. Cost savings associated with these opportunities are relatively low when compared to the cost savings from other capital expenditures; however, this allows Goodyear to reinvest in future conservation projects. Our plants in Americana, Brazil; Malaysia; and Aurangabad, India have all invested significantly in infrastructure upgrades and onsite wastewater treatment systems to help conserve water and implement cost savings. As we continue to evaluate the water stress situations in our operations, capital expenditures on wastewater treatment facilities and infrastructure upgrades will be considered in the planning process.
Goodyear analyzes the water stress and consumption at each manufacturing facility. These indicators are factored into future plans and capital expenditures to help improve overall water use at each facility. Capital expenditures have included installing closed-loop systems, onsite wastewater treatment systems, and upgrading infrastructure. Goodyear has also included water efficiency initiatives in the planning process for the new plant in San Lois Potosi, Mexico. This new facility is intended to be a zero discharge facility with the ability to reuse all process water on site.
Goodyear is committed to caring for the environment, and we believe our long-standing reputation as a responsible corporate citizen helps to increase our brand value. Corporate responsibility is ingrained in our culture.

With changing attitudes toward recycled water use there has been and will be increased public support for the infrastructure needed to change our golf courses to recycled water. One golf course in the Las Vegas area uses recycled water saving 550 megaliters/year. To connect a golf course to a reclaimed water system, costs local municipalities millions of dollars and is the lynchpin in order for Caesars to use recycled water.

Water Measurement and Performance: Since 2009, our water strategy has focused on reducing our water use by measuring water consumption and translating the data into relevant metrics that Hilton Team Members, franchise employees, owners and management groups can use to make decisions and set goals that improve performance and create long-term value. LightStay, our centralized measurement system allows us to collect water consumption data to uncover best practices we can leverage to develop companywide tools, processes and trainings to support our hotels. We require hotels to set goals based on their local operating context and environment. . In addition, we leverage our participation in association working groups and partnerships to understand opportunitiesto improve and drive shared value.  This sustainability strategy was implemented in 2009 with the introduction of LightStay, and both the financial and environmental impact has been significant.  For the owned and managed hotels, HWI has reduced its water use intensity by 14.9 percent from 2009-2015 (normalized water reduction per ft2/m2 against base year 2008).

Water-saving technologies: HWI works to promote investment and adoption of water efficient products and innovative technologies throughout HWI through various channels and vendor partnerships. Hilton has developed several partnerships that offer laundering technologies that can reduce hot water use by up to 45 percent. P&G Tide Coldwaterâ„¢ and Ecolab Aquanomicsâ„¢ are both laundry detergent solutions that eliminate hot water from the wash process and maximize laundry efficiency. We are also performing trials with the Xerosâ„¢ polymer bead-based washing system, which uses less water, energy and chemical detergents.  According to  Xeros, "New polymer bead cleaning technology swaps out up to 80% of the water needed for laundry with small polymer beads. By combining the beadsâ€™ molecular structure with a proprietary detergent solution, dirt from soiled items is attracted and absorbed by the beads, producing cleaner results. The reusable beads have a lifespan of hundreds of washes before being collected and recycled for reintroduction into the polymer supply chain. A hotel can cut its water consumption by about 16 percent overall just by implementing this new technology." (source: https://www.hotel-online.com/press_releases/release/energy-savings-often-overlooked-when-buying-commercial-laundry-equipment)While we typically pilot these innovations at our owned properties, Hilton impact in driving innovation extends throughout the hospitality industry.

Living Sustainably Campaigns: Our quarterly Living Sustainably campaigns empower Hilton Team Members (owned and managed hotel employees) and franchise employees to make changes that improve energy use, water efficiency and waste reduction. Our third-quarter campaign focuses on â€˜saving every last dropâ€™ of water, by providing hotels with simple tips for low- or no-cost water reduction activities that inspire many of our best practices around the world. The campaign encourages Hilton Team Members and franchise employees to identify where they use the most water in the hotel and to make simple operational changes to reduce the usage and identify new ways of conserving water. The campaign also rallies Hilton Team Members and franchise employees aroundWorld Water Week to identify and implement their own water saving ideas and inspire collective action. The financial impact is negligible and included in our Travel with Purpose programs
HWI sees increased future opportunity to make a difference globally with our Travel with Purpose mission.  Our Team Members and operations already have a significant impact on the thousands of local communities in which weâ€™re located by providing jobs, supporting local suppliers, protecting the environment and enhancing tourism. Examples of HWI initiatives in place to address increasing humanitarian demand across all global owned, managed and franchised properties include: 1. Our Global Month of Service is an annual celebration in which our hotels around the world host or participate in hands-on volunteer projects. In 2015, hotels from 92 countries participated in more than 4,100 community projects resulting in over 213,000 volunteer hours.2. In 2013, we launched Travel with Purpose Action Grants, a program designed to invest in our hotelsâ€™ ideas to address local issues that impact their communities. Since 2013, nearly 200 grants have been awarded, providing over $500,000 to local organizations in our communities around the world. In 2015, we received over 420 applications to support creative and local approaches to address social and environmental challenges.3. We developed the Hilton Worldwide Responds Fund to enable Hilton Team Members (owned and managed) and franchise employees to contribute to funds that support communities following a disaster. Since launching the Fund in 2013, we have matched donations for four disasters, raising more than $1.5 million dollars.

Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of severe droughts (or floods) in the future, reducing the availability of water. Water scarcity has the possibility to raise water costs in the future or to make certain operations impossible in some areas. These projections of future scarcity,  coupled with our publically-stated goals to reduce water consumption, increase the feasibility of investing in projects that will lower both water costs and water consumption.

Purchase of water to operate our facilities is part of Juniper OPEX. By successfully reducing water consumption it would drive cost savings. When retrofitting and building out new offices, Juniper considers opportunities to implement efficient water fixtures and reduce our dependency on potable water. Juniperâ€™s investments into water efficient fixtures in restrooms create water savings of 30% for the Sunnyvale headquarters. Additionally, by using native plants and recycled water for landscaping and other specific operations, Juniper is able to reduce our demand and spend on potable water.
Juniperâ€™s water efficiency and conservation practices contribute to our eligibility for the Bay Area Green Business certification, as well as the Sunnyvale campus buildingsâ€™ LEED Gold and Platinum certifications. Independent third-party certifications, like LEED, ISO 14001, and Bay Area Green Business, affirm our commitment to conservation and corporate citizenship to interested stakeholders, including customers, employees, investors and regulators. Juniperâ€™s customers, employees and investors currently assess companies on the basis of proactive environment and social responsibility stances and will continue to increase their focus on this as more regulations come into play and water management becomes a greater financial risk. Being certified by independent certification bodies contribute to our brand and helps Juniper stand out as an environmental leader.

Kellogg has a company-wide goal to reduce global water usage per tonne of food produced 15-20% by 2015 compared to a 2005 baseline. This goal encourages all facilities to reduce water usage which will improve water efficiency and deliver cost savings to the business. While we have not met the 15-20% reduction target, we have achieved a 7% reduction in water use per tonne of food produced and an absolute water use reduction of 10% since 2005. These reductions represent cost savings for the company. For example, during Kellogg 2015 Investor Day we shared our total estimated cost savings of approximately $22 Million USD from manufacturing sustainability achievements 2008-2014, which includes cost savings from increased water efficiency. And in 2014 and 2015, several facilities in North America completed water reuse projects by optimizing equipment settings and installing new water treatment technologies to their boiler steam systems. Because energy is also used in the process to generate steam, these projects reduce both water and energy use. Kellogg has a 2020 sustainability commitments, which include goals to reduce global water usage an additional 15% by 2020 compared to a 2015 baseline and to implement water reuse projects in 25% of our plants by 2020.

In 2015, Lockheed Martin demonstrated our commitment to energy solutions by combining several commercial energy products and service businesses into a single organization. Lockheed Martin Energy now delivers a comprehensive portfolio including: our bioenergy technology that converts waste into clean fuel; tidal energy technology; energy storage solutions that improve electrical grid efficiency and enable increased use of renewables; and energy management solutions and performance contracts that enable our customers to reduce their energy and deliver cost avoidances. Some of the renewable energy offerings we have in-place or in development today include ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), wave and tidal power, and waste-to-energy generation. Many of these technologies utilize the existing power in the oceans to generate clean energy. These provide energy generation opportunities that are less water intensive than traditional energy generation processes such as fossil fuel generation.
Lockheed Martin was selected by NASA to design and build the U.S. geostationary operational environment satellite series, GOES-R, which will be used by NOAA for short-term weather forecasting, to estimate rainfall and snow accumulation, detect early identification of storm intensification and severe weather. Scheduled to launch in 2016, this technology will provide the U.S. National Weather Service with advanced severe weather prediction capabilities to save lives in storm-threatened areas and help meteorologists issue winter storm warnings and spring snow melt advisories.
As part of our Go Green program, in 2015, Lockheed Martin established a 30% water reduction goal, which is an increase from our previous commitment of a 25% water reduction by 2020 measured from a 2010 baseline. This program promotes smart water stewardship to improve operational efficiencies. In 2015, we made our target more robust and increased the reduction to 30%. Since 2010, a team of experts including facilities and energy engineers called the Tiger Team has been conducting in-depth analyses of energy and water systems across the company to create strategic â€œget to excellenceâ€ plans that are site-specific. In 2015, 12 team improvement sessions were held for business segments to identify projects based on energy use and infrastructure sub-system optimization opportunities, which in turn affect water consumption. These projects focus on increased performance standards for our buildings and have resulted in significant operational cost avoidance. In 2015, we achieved energy and water cost avoidances of $28 million compared to 2010.

Our current strategy sets a target of further reducing water use 20 percent per occupied room by 2020 over 2007 levels.  As of YE 2015, we have reduced our global water consumption by 10.4% per occupied room.  We have accomplished this reduction through pursuit of a variety of actions designed to reduce water use at our hotel properties.
In pursuit of our water conservation goals, we have implemented a number of projects designed to enhance the efficient use of water at the hotels we manage. These include low-flow faucet and toilet fixtures, water sub-meters and more efficient laundry and dishwashing formulations.
Marriottâ€™s investment in signature conservation initiatives and reputation for environmental performance are important to our customers, especially in emerging markets where environmental issues have greater impact. Marriottâ€™s research on views of global business travelers, including research Marriott has conducted, has confirmed the importance of addressing concerns relevant to individual countries.
Marriott recognizes the increasing interest among its customers in calculating the environmental impact of their room stays and events. Hotels which can demonstrate and communicate their sustainability may attract more business from customers focused on environmental issues.
New recruits in the hotel industry are more likely to cite environmental leadership as a factor in choosing employers.  Employee engagement is a key factor in driving the success of our business and environmental strategy.

Ninety-seven percent of the water used in our value chain is for growing crops. Our impact assessments have identified a number of water-intensive agricultural raw materials grown in water-scarce areas, whose supply chain can be strengthened through better water management.In one example, we are working with basmati rice farmers in Pakistan to introduce alternate wetting anddrying, an irrigation technique that reduceswater and GHG emissions and improves yields, and is considered ground-breaking water management practice in the rice industry. Weâ€™re also taking part in a project led by the Swiss development organization, Helvetas, which aims to improve water efficiency and productivityfor rice growers in Asia. Nearly one thousand Pakistani rice farmers will directly benefit from this initiative, as it has linked them directly to a new value chain. Mars Food is a member of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP), an industry collaboration that has developed a globally applicable set of rice sustainability standards. The SRP has created 11 socioeconomic and environmental indicators, including water efficiency. Together with rice growers, buyers, producers, processors, retailers, governments and NGOs, weâ€™re sharingbest practices and partnering to improvestandards across the rice industry.

Microsoft can provide businesses and governments with technology and IT services that are resilient to local disruptions from flooding. With our georedundant datacenters, the likelihood of a significant weather-related disaster shutting down our services is very unlikely. Organizations in flood-affected areas can resume operations as soon as they are able to restore Internet access (or even continue operations without disruption from an alternative site with Internet access). We are investing to deliver cloud solutions across our product lines; two of our most significant services for businesses are Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure. Our global cloud service operations are supported by one of the largest physical networks in the world, with several industry certifications including ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and SAS70 Type II. We use geo-replicated customer workloads (keeping multiple copies of workloads in multiple locations) to improve reliability. We have more than 2,000 people working on cloud infrastructure and more than 30,000 software engineers involved in cloud-based activities. For organizations that rely on on-premises software, high-availability features such as replication and mirroring in our software enable organizations to design and implement reliable and resilient mission-critical solutions. This opportunity could help us maintain or exceed growth levels for our services (which in FY15, the reporting period, represented $93.58 billion in annual revenue).

Noble Energy is focused on securing independent water supplies to lower costs, reduce uncertainty and solidify social license to operate.
Noble Energy has joined the South Platte Water-Related Activities Program (SPWRAP) to offset the Companyâ€™s water usage in the DJ Basin.  SPWRAP is a Colorado non-profit corporation that assists in the recovery of species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through the development and operation of the Colorado Program component of the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program. This voluntary program provides a benefit to endangered species and communities, and increases the Companyâ€™s engagement with regulatory agencies, thereby benefiting the Companyâ€™s social license to operate. The cost to join SPWRAP in the first year (include back-payments to become a member in good standing from the programâ€™s start date) was approximately $100,000, and membership will require a small annual fee.
Noble Energy is committed to water recycling and reuse, implementing best management practices (BMPs) in the industry, and practicing environmental stewardship.   The company is working to increase recycling capacity and is testing innovative technologies to lower the cost of reuse and recycling. Water recycling reduces freshwater consumption and decreases downhole disposal volumes, which provide benefits to neighboring communities.
Noble Energyâ€™s water supply is developed from a previously contaminated aquifer.  Using this water instead of a new water supply mitigates potential conflicts between the Company and local water users and communities.

The aspirational goal of our Positive Water Impact initiative is to make more and/or better water available to the environment and communities where we operate and source. Our work toward this goal also presents opportunities for business and communities within stressed watersheds to develop processes, information, and technology improvements.
The initiatives in which we are engaged with our portfolio of NGO partners provide a transformative opportunity. Our collaboration with global partners is expected to result in greater water availability where it did not previously exist, thereby providing more sustainable access to water for the community, more sustainable solutions to the global water crisis, and more sustainable access to water for our manufacturing operations.
Conserving water is good for our business and the environment wherever we operate. By the end of 2015, we had reduced our water use per unit of production by 25.8% since 2006 from our legacy operations, exceeding our target of a 20 percent reduction and delivering a cost saving of approximately $19 million in 2015 as compared to a 2006 run rate. Our total water use fell from 95.8 million cubic meters in 2014 to 92.7 million cubic meters in 2015.
PepsiCo worked with our U.K. farmers to achieve a 50 percent reduction in agricultural carbon emissions of key growers and the water impact of key growers who operate in water-stressed areas by the end of 2015. Data for 2015 is not yet available. New varieties, investment in technology such as drip irrigation, and the data and information available through i-cropTM and Cool Farm Tool technologies provide confidence that our growers will meet this challenging target.
Our ability to achieve our goals is possible in part by collaborating with business, academic experts and NGOs. We are actively involved in the UN Global Compactâ€™s CEO Water Mandate, the WBCSD water leadership group, the International Finance Corporationâ€™s 2030 Water Resources Group and the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable. These forums allow us to learn from other companies and share our own experiences across a spectrum of industries, including food and beverage manufacturing, power generation and construction. This also enables us to discuss water-related issues and advance solutions on a pre-competitive basis.

PG&E offers customers a wide range of options to help them reduce their water use. Our water-saving solutions for residential customers include energy efficiency rebates for high-efficiency appliances, such as clothes washers and shower heads, and free wood chips for landscape mulching, which reduces evaporation. We also offer incentives to agricultural customers who convert from sprinkler systems to water-efficient drip irrigation, as well as programs for energy efficient pumping systems and more.
PG&E led a grassroots Water Wise Pledge Campaign that encouraged employees to make a pledge to reduce their water usage at work and at home.
We achieved water reductions in our offices and service yards by finding and repairing leaks and replacing facility landscapes with drought-resistant designs, plants and materials. Outside 60 of our facilities, browning lawns displayed signs supporting the stateâ€™s Save Our Water drought message.
PG&Eâ€™s San Francisco Service Center Garage Building achieved LEED Platinum after a remodel and seismic retrofit. As part of the remodel, we created a system to capture groundwater from an aquifer that runs under the building and use it for the buildingâ€™s cooling system.
PG&E held a Water Conservation Showcase at our Pacific Energy Center in San Francisco, bringing together hundreds of industry professionals to hear from experts and engage with new technologies. For PG&E, the event is an extension of our focus on energy efficiency and sustainability, highlighting the direct connection between water and energy use.
PG&E placed a â€œSave Our Waterâ€ message on bills and envelopes sent to 4 million customers. Our 1.7 million e-bill customers received the drought message in e-bill inserts. We posted â€œSevere drought warningâ€ signage at 200 buildings as well as at PG&Eâ€™s campgrounds located near our hydroelectric facilities.
PG&E provided $2 million in funding to local Fire Safe Councils for projects including creating emergency access roads and fire breaks, clearing fire fuel and helping residents create defensible space. PG&E also provided funding for daily aerial fire patrols along four routes to assist state and local fire agencies with early detection and response to stop fires from spreading.

Some of our technology solutions may enable water efficiency and conservation â€“ in utilities distribution and monitoring or home appliances, for example. However, we have not yet quantified this information.
In 2015, we continued to fund capital-improvement projects to further reduce, recycle and reuse water, especially in newly owned facilities. We plan to use our water champions to strategically focus and further increase our water-efficiency efforts. We also plan to do a feasibility study of at least one large, high-impact water-saving project. We will continue efforts to use water efficiently and reduce total water use. Our 2015 absolute reduction goal was to reduce total water use by 4 percent. In 2015 we achieved a 12 percent reduction in total annual water use.

In 2015 UTC completed a major revision to our supply management program. By 2020, over 60% of our supply chain spend will be with "Gold Level" suppliers. In addition to traditional supplier performance criteria (price, quality, on-time delivery), we are increasing the resilience and reliability of these key suppliers by requiring them to annually improve their use of water, either through absolute reductions or improvement in water use efficiency per $1 million of revenue. In addition to a reduction in potential supplier business disruption, UTC believes that better water management can result in suppliers becoming more sensitized to the subject of water as a business risk, which in turn will lead to greater levels of water use reduction on their part along with pushing out similar requirements to their own (UTC Tier II) suppliers

In 2014, WhiteWave Foods commissioned a comparative cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Analysis and Water Footprint study of the environmental impacts associated with the production of Silk Soy, Almond, and Coconut beverages vs. Dairy beverages. The study accounts for emissions and water used in the entire supply chain, from agriculture to product use and disposal, and has been peer reviewed. The study found that, over the product lifecycle, plant based beverages use on average 900 fewer gallons of water per half gallon of finished product than its comparable dairy beverage products. We believe that our plant-based product portfolio, which currently accounts for more than 38% of our sales, appeals to customers who care about water conservation and helps to insulate our company against the negative impacts of climate change and drought. We will continue to invest in and grow our plant-based product portfolio.

Due to our Great Lakes basin and Mississippi River basin locations, many of our generating stations utilize once-through cooling. 100% of the water used for once-through cooling is returned to the water body. Among options for power plant cooling, our open cycle systems are the most efficient technology choice. Therefore, this form of cooling maximizes plant efficiency and affords lower carbon emissions per unit of electrical generation compared to any other cooling technology options.

Where appropriate and possible, Yahoo uses existing hydropower for electricity to power its data centers. Existing hydropower affords us low-carbon electricity that is also low cost and less vulnerable to the price fluctuations that can result from changes to the cost of fossil fuel for regions that are more dependent upon coal or natural gas. We currently use hydropower in our owned and operated data centers in Quincy, Washington and Lockport, New York to take advantage of this opportunity.
YCC (Yahoo Compute Coop) design for low-water cooling of data centers is a strategy we are using to realize lower water use. Our Yahoo Compute Coop air-cooled data center design uses over 90 percent less water than conventional water- cooled data center design.  Our WUE in our Lockport, New York data center is ,031.  For roughly 200 hours out of the year during hot and humid conditions, we use a direct evaporative cooling system. Typically the system generates no or minimal wastewater, resulting in savings from both avoided cost of water and avoided cost of wastewater disposal. We estimate the resulting savings to be less than $150K per year at our Lockport facility. Should costs of water and wastewater increase in the future or prove more expensive in other locations, savings will likely increase.

Under Blueline â€“ Yum!â€™s proprietary green building standards â€“ stores realize an average cost savings of $500 per year related to water. The Sustainability team currently works with the brandsâ€™ development teams in each market to implement the standards and verify them through an easy-to-use online tool. This drives progress toward our goal to have 100% of new company-owned restaurants designed and built to Blueline standards by 2016.
Yum! stores are able to improve their water efficiency by updating water fixtures in their kitchen, drink station, bathroom, and irrigation systems. To make sure these fixtures are utilized and updated, when appropriate, we occasionally sub-meter buildingsâ€™ water usage to realize opportunities and incorporate water efficiency into Yum!â€™s green building standards. Since 2005, our water efficiency projects have saved over 800 million gallons of water across the globe.
There is opportunity for us to build positive community relations by being a good environmental steward, which includes our focus on water conservation. Thatâ€™s why we continually evaluate the impact water has on our business and the communities we serve through tools like WRI Aqueduct and materiality assessments.
SRI investors consider water risks and opportunities in their evaluation of our public securities through their consideration of ESG research from MSCI, Sustainalytics, Bloomberg, CDP, Ceres, and other sources. We therefore pursue water efficiency efforts that generate a positive return on investment and disclose them as part of our targeted communications with SRI investors through the mediums mentioned above.
Recognize water as an important opportunity, engage early and broadly, operate responsibly. This opportunity will Increase our potential to gain a license, community's approval or accelerate the permitting process.  This may reduce project costs and timelines by identifying more collaborative approaches and by engaging proactively with communities of interest.For example, Teck is engaging with numerous Communities of Interest (COIs) as part of our efforts to address water quality constituents released by mining activities throughout the Elk River watershed, where five of our steelmaking coal operations are located.
Identify and assess opportunities to generate power and create revenue and renewable energy.
Set targets and identify and implement projects to improve water use efficiency.Water use efficiency can be improved through enhanced water recycling and reuse.  In 2014, our operations developed site-specific water targets and successfully worked towards implementing projects and initiatives to meet these targets in 2015.For example, we are currently conducting trials to minimize the volume of water required for dust control.  By adding a surfactant to the water used for dust control on our haul roads, our trials have demonstrated that we can reduce the volume of water needed by half, which also creates cost savings in labour and energy (fuel) consumption for our water trucks. We estimate that we can cut costs associated with dust control by almost half.
Establish reputation as a leader in water stewardship

Water is a critical component for our customers to mix with our powder formula for infants and children to consume.  Mead Johnson continues to investigate opportunities to expand the ready to drink formulations.
Our water conservation strategy is focused on the following initiatives:  smart metering/leak detection, landscaping/irrigation improvements, expansion of non-freshwater sources, and efficient water infrastructure.  Examples of progress made in 2015 include: (1) Smart meters - Six HP Co. sites located in Israel installed nearly 100 smart meters which alert staff to potential water leaks and suspicious water flows. Fixing these leaks has reduced water use by 20-25% on average. In 2016, we will expand use of this technology to other sites in Europe and plan to launch our first pilot in the United States. (2) Improved irrigation and landscaping - Two HP Co. sites in California, now shared by HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), responded to local drought conditions by changing landscape and irrigation practices. The Roseville site cut water consumption for irrigation by 34% compared to 2014 and 70% compared to 2013 by upgrading the irrigation control system and adhering to a strict watering schedule. The San Jose Aviation site completed a turf removal project estimated to save more than 11,300 cubic meters of water per year. (3) Water infrastructure upgrades - In Guadalajara, Mexico, a HP Co. site inherited by HP Inc. replaced leaking pipes and a pump that feed well water into a site cistern. Once fixed, water consumption dropped approximately 80%, saving an estimated 60,000 cubic meters of water per year.
Our strategy to realize cost savings has been to pursue projects with an ROI of 3 years or less.  A few examples include: (1) leak detection projects in Israel are averaging an ROI of 2 years or better. (2) Infrastructure improvements to the water delivery system in Guadalajara achieved an ROI less than 1 year.  (3) The turf removal project at one of our Palo Alto sites quickly paid for itself thanks to some generous water conservation incentives from the local municipality.

Reducing the amount of water used in our manufacturing processes and recycling initiatives to reduce the use of our natural resources would provide cost savings in our operational spend.
In the reporting year Tessy Plastics, despite pressure from an existing customer to relocate a major section of our business to South Carolina, elected to invest over $30,000,000  for the 240,000 square foot expansion of our facility in central NY.  This expansion will allow us to mold, store and assemble finished components parts for major manufacturers of personal hygiene products.  This will result in efficiencies in the use of water, electricity and other natural resources.  This competitive advantage will increase our sales an estimated 5-8%.  The opportunity in our water risk is that our locations in New York are at a lower risk for overall water risk and physical risk to quality than the area in South Carolina based on the assessment tool WRI Aqueduct.   Water being critical to injection molding this gives us a competitive advantage because water scarcity and flooding are considered not relevant for our New York State operations.

Pinnacle continues to look for opportunities to reduce total water usage as well as reuse of water after processing which will directly result in overall cost savings.  We've established 2020 goals to reduce our overall water consumption by 40% and through 2015, have reduced water usage by 36% through a combination of investments in new equipment and continuous improvement programs at our manufacturing plants. For example, through a combination of improved throughputs, efficiency projects and capital investments, we have saved over 100 million gallons of water annually at our Fort Madison IA plant.
While water is a main ingredient in most products, reducing water use by finding more efficient ways (such as recycling), our plan is to find cost savings in our COGS and utility bills.
As discussed later in Question 9.1a. water usage at the Hanesbrands textile facilities is directly linked to energy usage, as some water must be heated as part of the bleaching and dyeing processes.  Reducing water volume required for these processes also reduces fuel requirements and has a positive impact on carbon emissions. Through process improvements and innovation, Hanesbrands has reduced water usage.  In some facilities, this reduces the fees paid to the government or to a third-party supplier.  At five of its major textile facilities, Hanesbrands operates its own water treatment and wastewater treatment plants on site.  Volume reductions also impact the costs associated with water treatment.Hanesbrands has communicated its achievements in energy, water, and carbon management through its "Hanes for Good" website, and has noted its US  ENERGY STAR awards in its catalogs and social media.  Hanesbrands has been recognized for its environmental stewardship (to include water resource management at both the corporate level and at the facility and country level.Hanesbrands continues to search for alternative technologies and process innovations to conserve water and to investigate options for recycling additional water within the manufacturing process.

As discussed later in Question 9.1a. water usage at the Hanesbrands textile facilities is directly linked to energy usage, as some water must be heated as part of the bleaching and dyeing processes.  Reducing water volume required for these processes also reduces fuel requirements and has a positive impact on carbon emissions. Through process improvements and innovation, Hanesbrands has reduced water usage.  In some facilities, this reduces the fees paid to the government or to a third-party supplier.

Regeneron is actively installing low flow water fixtures in existing facilities, and experimenting with rainwater collection systems in several locations. By lowering our water spending, we are decreasing our cost of goods sold and reducing any risks to future water price increases. We anticipate savings of less than $1,000,000 on this opportunity.
In order to identify areas with the greatest opportunity to increase our water efficiency, Regeneron has invested in equipment to sub-meter our water consumption at all of our locations, with the goal of company-wide sub-metering by 2018.
All new and renovated buildings at Regeneron have low flow plumbing fixtures, which have dramatically cut our water consumption per employee.

Altria's overall water consumption decreased 6.8 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. With the help of ongoing water stewardship efforts including on-site water treatment at one Philip Morris USA facility and the company's support of non-profit conservation efforts, Altria was able to offset 47.8% of total water usage in 2015. Altria supports the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's work in the Columbia River, Cumberland Plateau, and Chesapeake Bay watersheds which helps protect and restore some of the most important ecosystems in the nation. Part of the risks these ecosystems face is due to water quality and quantity issues. These issues continue to be identified and monitored by grantees of NFWF's programs, and inform Altria's understanding of how to continue to direct environmental contributions resources in the communities in which we live and work.

Water consumption is measured at each company facility and water reduction activities provide operational cost savings. An example of these activities at an operating company level includes Ste. Michelle Wine Estates' conservation activities within their facilities and vineyards. While water is necessary for production, Ste. Michelle works to reduce water usage in its wineries, developways to treat or reuse water consumed, and take positive steps in partnerships with others to conserve water in its communities while protecting biodiversity. From irrigating estate vineyards to treatingwastewater at its manufacturing facilities, Ste. Michelle has a long history of innovation that allows its wineries to bemore efficient with the water resources required for operation. These efforts include:-Conservation of hot water and increased efficiency of tank heating systems,-Re-use of winery gray water, -Use of water-conserving nozzles of cellar hoses,-Implementation of enhanced heat exchangers which reduce water needs in fermentation cellars,-Employee education on water conservation during performance of job duties, and-Maintenance of water-efficient landscaping on winery groundsThese initiatives have been ongoing at Ste. Michelle's vineyards, and specific cost savings year over year from these activities are not currently tracked at an enterprise-level. The water initiatives of Ste. Michelle can also serve as examples for its peer operating companies within Altria Group, Inc.

Anadarko is currently assessing and designing technologies and opportunities to continue to enhance such systems. For example, in four onshore operating areas, Anadarko has constructed and continues to enhance water recycling and delivery systems.
Anadarko is currently installing and operating equipment and systems to increase water recycling and anticipates it will continue to do so into the future. For example, in West Texas a water recycling system has resulted in the reuse of more than 1 million barrels of produced water. In Pennsylvania, when we are completing wells we aim to reuse 100% of flowback water recovered from our operations.
As cited by Energy In Depth on its website, the combustion of 1 Bcf of natural gas as a source of fuel creates more than 11 million gallons, or nearly 42 megaliters of water as vapor, a volume which is not typically accounted for in the measurement of life cycle water management for the oil and gas industry. Anadarko is working with industry to develop a valid approach to evaluating this aspect of the use of natural gas.

We see opportunities for our business in the issuance of climate or green bonds: fixed income, liquid financial instruments for raising debt capital for climate mitigation or adaptation projects and other environmentally beneficial activities. Green bonds were created to increase funding by accessing the $100 trillion bond market and expanding the investor base for climate projects worldwide. Our highly ranked ESG Research team which publishes quarterly reports on the green bond market.  According to a May 2016 Thematic Investing report from this team, the green bonds market stood at $121 billion as of April 30 2016 and this year is on track to be the 5th consecutive year of record green bond issuances. The market is now comprised of over 700 bonds, from 26 countries, in 24 currencies.The impacts of climate change on water resources will be a critical focus for adaptation efforts. In its Global Risks 2016 report, the World Economic Forum cited water stress as the global risk of highest concern for the next 10 years. The report predicts that water demand is projected to exceed sustainable supply by 40% in 2030. Aging infrastructure compounds the problem; according to the US Conference of Mayors, the US needs as much as $4.8 trillion in water and wastewater investment over the next 20 years. There is a range of ways in which our financing and advisory services can be put to use in this area, and this has become a significant focus for our ESG and sustainability research team.
The commitments weâ€™ve made represent both an understanding of the challenges we face and a willingness to help society address the issue of climate change. As a global financial institution, we can and will continue looking for ways to overcome obstacles in catalyzing capital investments toward a low-carbon economy and providing the necessary financing to realize the promise of global climate commitments.For example, in 2015, we served as a lead bookrunner for the District of Columbia Water & Sewer Authority ($100 million) to finance a portion of the DC Clean Rivers Project. Additionally, we were the lead underwriter on a $189 million green bond issued by the City of Los Angeles, CA to finance construction and improvement of the wastewater collection and treatment system, and a $51 million green bond issued by the city of Asheville, NC, to finance multiple watershed and water service protection projects. Finally, in 2015, Bank of America announced a $1 million grant to Water.org, a global organization that provides innovative, community-led and market-based solutions that change lives through safe water and sanitation. The grant will empower 100,000 people in southern India to obtain safe water and sanitation solutions, accelerating positive change in their homes and communities.

This is a strategic evaluation for us as much of the water used for ore processing is recycled or reused at our operations.
Develop new technologies to incorporate sea water into processing. We developed a new technology, an Air-Metabisulfite treatment (AMBS), which enables the copper flotation process to use seawater, saline or brackish water with minimal metallurgical impact compared to fresh or desalinated water. This improves metallurgy significantly (compared to a lime process) and allows us to reduce potential energy requirements, if water treatment was previously required." The cost saving for eliminating the need for water treatment facilities  could cost tens or hundreds of millions US dollars as CAPEX and OPEX.
Increased cost for water as a result of constrained availability makes capital investments in water conservation methods(or projects with a longer ROI) more feasible and save more money over the lifetime of the project.   With support from management we are making changes to investment guidelines related to sustainability related projects. This will accelerate investment in projects which reduce energy consumption and water.

A key focus within our manufacturing operation is to increase plant productivity while decreasing our environmental footprint â€“ which we believe will provide major benefits in our continuing efforts to reduce the energy, carbon, water, and waste impacts of producing our therapies. By successfully applying three-fold productivity improvements to two key candidates in the companyâ€™s mid-stage pipeline, we have been able to produce more drug substance without increasing the companyâ€™s water and energy consumption. We are exploring new approaches that have the potential to significantly decrease the water and energy resources needed to manufacture a dose of medicine. A third initiative linked to this goal is to decrease or eliminate the use of solvents in the manufacturing of a new class of drug compounds.The centerpiece of this strategy is underway in Solothurn, Switzerland, where we are building a next-generation, largescale biologics manufacturing facility. This facility will be one of the most advanced of its kind. When the facility is operational, we hope to produce 10 metric tons of antibodies per year, making it three times more productive than our other facilities currently in use.
Biogen consumes a substantial amount of potable water each year for heat rejection, largely through evaporative losses at cooling towers. The major Biogen sites can eliminate evaporative potable water consumption associated with cooling towers by implementing the following technologies: Adiabatic Coolers and Hybrid Cooling Towers (RTP), Ground Water System (HillerÃ¸d), Dry-Coolers (Cambridge).
Through a screening life cycle assessment to map and quantify the environmental impacts of the next-generation manufacturing process compared to traditional approaches, we focused on the acquisition of material inputs, like water and energy, through the production of the drug substance that goes into our final products. The results of the assessment are very promising, indicating that the next generation manufacturing process is significantly less energy intensive per kilogram of output and is more water efficient. Based on the projections of water demand for the new process compared to the current process, the assessment indicated that the next generation process may be expected to use 44 percent less water per batch and 89 percent less water per kilogram of output.
As part of our ISO 50001, we will work to reduce incremental use per batch from 3,500 m3 to below 3,250 m3 water treated per batch, and natural gas usage for steam production to < 22,000 m3 per batch.
With no MPA segregation, all waste from Cell culture is collected and transported off site for treatment (incineration). Currently 125 m3 wastewater is collected per batch and this volume is expected to increase with 75% to 100% (220-250m3) when T3-H2-P2 is up running. By implementing MPA segregation the wastewater can be reduced to approx. 40-41m3 per batch (savings 3,570m3 for 2016, 18,000m3 up to 2019).
As part of the HillerÃ¸d Symbiosis we have identified an opportunity for saving chemicals for neutralization of the wastewater. This is cooperation with the public wastewater treatment plant who is establishing a new wastewater treatment plant in HillerÃ¸d. As part of this establishment a pipe is going to be installed from the old wastewater treatment plan to the new one â€“ passing by Biogen. If we are a part of the pipe we do not need to neutralize the wastewater before discharge due to the larger quantity wastewater that will pass by us. This is a great saving for the environment (chemicals) and for us (resources in terms of FTE work).
Our process engineers, facilities and EHS+S staff also work continually to maintain and improve upon the high-quality water used in our processes. For example, our HillerÃ¸d facility completed an innovation fund project â€“ funded through our Strategic Innovation office â€“ addressing the reuse of process water. This project is being evaluated for implementation at other sites, including the new facility in Solothurn, Switzerland.
In 2015, our newly renovated office in Tokyo, Japan, was recognized by the local government for key sustainable design features: Rain water, sink water and cooling water from boilers is purified and recycled and used in washrooms.
Biogenâ€™s RTP-DP site currently has a tap installed on the Durham Gray Water System, and are investigating cost to tie in gray water to a small section of our lawn irrigation. If this works out as planed we will tie in all of the irrigation for the campus, and will evaluate using gray water in our cooling tower and eliminate the use of city water in the cooling towers.

In areas of greater water risk, Brown-Forman continues to develop projects which will ultimately lower our water consumption and wastewater discharge, giving us an advantage over our competitors who may lack such efficiency.Brown-Formanâ€™s water conservation and efficiency efforts have reduced costs directly by purchasing less water. As a result of our efficiency efforts during this reporting year, both our water withdrawal and water intensity (gal/product) has decreased. We estimate cost savings associated with this intensity reduction to be a moderate decrease in our global operating costs.

Global trade in grains and oilseeds is expected to double from 300 to 600 million metric tons by 2050.  This increase will be driven in part by an increase in the trade of â€œvirtualâ€ waterâ€”water embedded in products such as agricultural commodities.   Bungeâ€™s diverse, global operations enable it both to promote and benefit from virtual water trade by supplying regions with water-intensive crops that cannot be efficiently produced locally.

Near-term dislocations in global agricultural trade flows due to climate or water related impacts on agricultural production and commodity availability present opportunities for Bunge to leverage its global asset network to serve customers and meet demand in times of shortage.
One of the opportunities has been the development of goals.  We currently have a goal to reduce our water use by 50% by 2020.  We have also committed to reducing water use in our top 5 agricultural ingredients by 20%.  These goals have led us to develop more efficient processes.
We believe in the importance of stakeholder engagement and it is part of our overall CSR and environmental strategy.  Understanding water risks and having strategies in place to mitigate such risks can help  with these stakeholder relationships.
Having a goal helps us to embed sustainability throughout and triggers water efficiency projects, which often results in a cost savings.  In addition, this often triggers innovation.

Cisco is currently investigating how to reduce its water consumption at its campus in San Jose, California. Although most water fixtures were replaced with more water efficient options within the last 5 years, we believe there are still opportunities that exist today to cost-effectively reduce our water consumption at the campus. Over the next year, Cisco's facilities' team will be evaluating all of our existing water fixtures in sinks, bathrooms and cafeterias to determine exactly which fixtures could be replaced with more efficient options. The team has also successfully turned off the campuses' last water fountains and converted them into planter beds with native, drought-resistant plants. This initiative has helped Cisco reduce water, energy and maintenance costs by approximately $100,000 USD per year.

We reduced our water consumption company-wide by 14% (per case of product sold) from 2008 to 2011. In 2012, we set a new goal to further reduce our water consumption by 20% per case of product sold by 2020 vs. 2011 base year. Three years into this new goal period, we have already reduced water consumption by 14% vs. this new goal (in addition to the 14% reduction achieved previously).  In 2012, we converted our namesake bleach to a 33% more concentrated formula. It also helps reduce our water footprint since it is 33% more concentrated and makes for more efficient distribution. As a result of our water audits at our 9 most water intensive manufacturing sites, we have budgeted for capital improvement projects to reduce water consumption and improve current utilization. In addition, we have several LEED certified sites globally which utilize water reduction strategies to minimize fresh water use and overall community impact. Water awareness training is conducted for all manufacturing employees in the United States and Latin America.

Additional information: Since 2005, we have reduced our water use intensity by over a third.Colgate invests in water conservation strategies at our global facilities viaour manufacturing capital program and by implementing our Water StewardshipStandard. The Standard outlines best practices to reduce and recycle water in our manufacturing sites. we also have a Global Manufacturing Water Reduction team focused on water reduction strategies and projects.Our LEED-certified manufacturing facilities utilize various water reduction strategies to minimize fresh water use and overall community impacts. Additionally, to help increase support for the "5% for the Planet" capital funding initiative, Colgate developed a "True" Cost of Water tool designed to give increased visibility to some of the hidden water costs in manufacturing such as purchase cost, pumping & treatment costs, wastewater treatment and discharge costs. The results indicated about a 3x increase in the "True" water cost vs the purchase cost alone, thus enabling more favorable paybacks for site water conservation projects.

Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to our manufacturing processes and is needed to produce the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. If the communities we serve are not sustainable, we cannot have a sustainable business.

In 2015, CNX Water Assets became CONVEY Water Systems (CONVEY).  CONVEY manages produced water from our E&P operations with the goal of reducing disposal volumes and the use of freshwater, and increasing the use of recycled water in well drilling activities.
CONSOL Energy serves as a model for other operators in the Appalachian Basin by committing to following the CSSD standards, which go above and beyond federal and state regulation.  We hope to serve as a model for other companies in the region, and build trust among a diverse, cross-section of stakeholders by operating beyond a compliancemindset.  All producers in the Appalachian Basin are able to apply for CSSD certification, but CONSOL Energy is one of the few that has taken the challenge and become certified to all 15 standards.

We continue to investigate and implement strategies for reducing water use while continuing to produce brands of the highest quality and we also continue to manage water risk as part of our business strategy. This is not only true of our operations in California â€“ we are actively managing and reducing our use of water at our facilities worldwide. During FY16, we spent greater than $3.5 million USD on water initiatives in California. In Mexico, our brewery reuses 26% of its incoming water and has a water efficiency rate of 3.32 liters of water/liter of product; which is one of the best in the industry. Not only does responsible water use conserve valuable resources, but it also results in operational cost savings.
Improved water use efficiency can reduce costs (e.g. reduced pumping, reduced treatment volumes, etc.) at production facilities while also resulting in positive environmental impacts.  In recognition of their sustainability efforts, we awarded Clos du Bois (located in Geyserville, California) with our second internal sustainability award based on FY15 data during FY16. This award is given annually to one Constellation Brands facility worldwide that has shown outstanding efforts in reducing carbon emissions and water usage, as well as recycling/reuse programs, community/supplier involvement and "Green Team" activities. The annual award increases visibility of our wide-ranging sustainability initiatives, increases employee participation in local sustainability programs, and encourages progress towards meeting our sustainability goals. An 8 minute video was produced focusing on the Clos du Bois sustainability story which includes their energy and water reduction initiatives . The employees at Clos du Bois were given a recognition luncheon at which they were presented the award by Senior Management. We will award another facility for their outstanding environmental initiatives based on FY16 data during the fall of FY17.  During FY16, greater than $3.5 million USD was spent on water initiative as well as on the employee engagement opportunity with the internal sustainability award.

Water management is an important lever of agricultural and turf productivity around the globe.  Our product and service offerings enable our customers to manage water in the agricultural setting in the following ways: water-efficient tillage practices, and laser-levelled fields.  For example, soil moisture monitoring can help growers understand moisture levels to better understand crop progress, as well as direct irrigation scheduling. Soil moisture monitoring tools use field-installed probes to monitor moisture levels at various depths, which allow water to be applied for the effective uptake of nutrients, or for the application of less water.  In addition, John Deere products such as sprayers and nutrient applicators are designed to minimize environmental impact throughout their lifecycle which mitigates negative impact on water quality.

These advances are allowing us to use produced water for our well completion operations in the United States, which reduces our need for fresh water. The initiatives we take to manage our water and limit our demand for fresh water enhances the trust we receive from communities that surround us. It also can help lower our operating costs and puts us in a better position to comply with future regulatory mandates designed to limit fresh water use.   In Canada, Devon is a member of the Canadaâ€™s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA). Water is one of four Environmental Priority Areas that Devon  participates in as part of COSIA in Alberta. Through the water EPA, members are working toward innovative and sustainable solutions to reduce water use and increase recycling rates.

Dow has several water stewardship programs - 3 major efforts are described in the 2015 Sustainability report.  Efforts in Terneuzen, Freeport and Tarragona represent partnerships with municipal treatment facilities to reuse effluent water in the plant, thereby reducing freshwater intake at those sites.  Water reuse at those 3 sites resulted in a freshwater intake reduction of an average of 35% for those sites.
Opportunities for water use reductions and efficiencies may be available. Each generation decision, however, is highly site dependant and includes numerous other factors in addition to water use.

The new technologies save water and are targeted at locations with water stress and risk issues. Our Powertrain and Vehicle Operations divisions have developed tools which evaluate the environmental impacts of new engine, transmission, and vehicleprograms, and determine theoptimum investments to achieve environmental improvement. These toolsexamine the impact of the newprogram on many different environmental media, including water.
The analysis that Ford conducted included water used in material production, production of parts, assembly, use, and disposal at end-of life.  In the supply chain, the production and processing of metals (in particular steel and aluminum) require the most water. Identifying which portions of the supply chain are most water-intensive allows us to better assess the business risk associated with using different suppliers in potentially water stressed areas.  Information on this analysis appears in Ford's Sustainability Report and is used to inform our efforts with suppliers.
Our work on developing new technologies for water stressed areas can be leveraged to save money in other locations. These operations become more viable as the cost of water increases.  Improving water efficiency within our operations reduces usage and wastewater generated, thereby saving the company money.
This technology enables consolidation of painting activities in an integrated booth, offering the potential to eliminate one booth water wash section, depending on plant design.  3-Wet is being replicated at Ford plants around the globe, including facilities in North America and Asia Pacific.
This system eliminates water usage from the painting process, resulting in an 80 percent water savings for air conditioning/air tempering and 100 percent water savings from paint-over-spray separation, based on production volume of 158,000 units per year.
MQL uses an extremely small amount of oil versus conventional wet-machining. For a typical production line of 450,000 vehicles, MQL can save 282,000 gallons of water per year.  This technology is being replicated at Ford powertrain plants around the globe.
We are increasing usage of internal water metering to identify additional water saving opportunities, better control water usage by functional area and drive conservation behaviors to the department level.
Ford is pilot testing ways to save water at our cooling towers, which are one of the biggest water users at our plants. Weâ€™re trying new technologies that soften the water so that there are fewer salts to cause equipment scaling. This allows us to reuse the water through the cooling towers many more times before the hardness requires us to bring freshwater in, reducing the amount of freshwater needed for cooling processes and comfort cooling. This technology is being replicated at Ford plants across the globe.
In 2014, we marked the 10th anniversary of the rebuilt Dearborn Truck Plant, which was hailed as a model of sustainable manufacturing when we rebuilt it in 2004. The facility incorporates stormwater management systems designed to emulate a natural system, including what was then the largest green roof in the world.  Louisville Assembly Plant installed porous pavers for their employee parking lot, which helps with storm water management. The plant received Ford's US/Canada Environmental Leadership Award for this project. Ford's Cuautitlan, Mexico Assembly plant has implemented ecological concrete as well. Additional details are provided below.
 Ecological concrete is less expensive than traditional concrete and is maintenance-free. As a result, this has saved the plant approximately $40,000 a year in maintenance costs.

There are reputational opportunities for those companies adequately managing water risk. Additionally, cost savings in the form of energy savings (pumping, heating) are accrued as we are more efficient with water.  Assuring that suppliers have sufficient water to produce the ingredients we need will provide supply chain resilience.

Hudbayâ€™s mine sites in Manitoba have access to an ample supply of freshwater resources. From an operations perspective, access to reliable sources of water is beneficial because it minimizes the capital costs and logistical difficulties associated with acquiring this resource.
Hudbayâ€™s mine site in Peru (Constancia) has access to plentiful water resources. From an operations perspective, access to reliable sources of water is beneficial because it minimizes the capital costs and logistical difficulties associated with acquiring this resource.
Hudbay's advanced exploration site in Arizona (Rosemont) is in a desert region with restricted access to water. Therefore, we plan to implement technologies, such as dry-stack tailings, to minimize water use. We also plan to replace all groundwater pumped with replacement surface waters from the Central Arizona Project (CAP). Our team conducted extensive baseline studies of surface and groundwater conditions in the project area and has incorporated considerations of these conditions into the development of the design as well as future management and mitigation plans for Rosemont.

Better water management will become increasingly important throughout the economy as climate change and regulatory responses drive reduced water availability or increased water costs. This creates opportunity for our newer and more energy efficient product lines (due to the energy-water nexus), as well as innovative products designed to help consumers and businesses better manage their water use. Our Internet of Things Group, for example, which deals in segments such as smart buildings, transportation, agricultural applications, and manufacturing and energy, had a net revenue of $2.2 billion in 2015.  In spring of 2016, our CEO announced a restructuring of Intel that would further emphasize future focus on the IoT Group as a key growth area for Intel.

We manage opportunities to invest in water efficiency. First, we actively work to identify regions that are exposed to current and projected risks, and we analyze our current and future water scarcity risks using tools such as the WRI Aqueduct risk tool in 2014. Then, we set meaningful goals to reduce our water consumption, focusing on these water-stressed areas. An example would be the series of chilled water system optimization projects that have been and still are being implemented. They aim to reduce water consumption by over 23 million gallons; they will also have a positive impact on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.At the end of 2015, we achieved 7.2% decrease of water consumption compared to the baseline of 2010. Although we didn't meet our goal of 10%, we do consider this as a success, because the large production volume increase, partly obscured the water reduction results.In 2015 , the next 2020 goals have been drafted: the 2020 water goal states " Conduct comprehensive water risk assessment for manufacturing / R&D locations and implement resource protection plans at the high-risk sites by YE 2020"This will truly put focus on the sites with the highest water risk in order to invest strategically in those areas.

Buildings account for the use of 40% of all energy, 68% of electricity and 88% of all potable water throughout the world, so there are significant opportunities to help customers save both water and energy, and also to save water within our own operations including our plants and buildings. We see a growing opportunity to meet customersâ€™ resource efficiency needs, including water efficiency.  Currently our total Building Efficiency business across all products and services represents 28% of our enterprise revenue.
This customer project helps reduce both water and energy consumption. Johnson Controls together with Affiliated Engineers, Inc., helped Stanford engineers deliver a custom-engineered heat-recovery process that is 70 percent more efficient than the cogeneration process Stanford used since 1987. York heat-recovery chillers will meet more than 90 percent of campus heating demands by capturing almost two-thirds of the waste heat generated by the campus cooling system to produce hot water for the heating system. Along with a Metasys building automation system, Johnson Controls developed the Enterprise Optimization System, a predictive control software system to optimize cost and energy use based on the 10 day weather forecast and future grid electricity prices. The software is designed to predict hourly campus heating and cooling needs, and then determine how to best run the heat recovery, heating, and cooling equipment inside. It also will determine how much hot and cold water to store in the CEF's water thermal storage tanks for later use. While it is a fact that our water conservation efforts for customers are still smaller when compared to our energy conservation business, we have seen a growing demand for them.

Our corporate campus was awarded LEEDÂ® Platinum certification.  The 33-acre site showcases our energy-efficient and sustainable building products and services. Since the renovation, energy and water usage has been reduced significantly, despite the doubling of office space by over 160,000 square feet. Some of the sustainable features include: A 30,000-gallon cistern captures rainwater from all new roof surfaces for reuse, reducing potable water consumption for new bathroom fixtures by 77 percent or 595,000 gallons per year. Solar generation produces the electricity needed in the new buildings while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A 1,330 ft2 solar thermal installation on the roof annually saves 2,837 therms of energy. Skylights and increased window space reduce the use of energy for indoor lighting.
To achieve this goal, several projects across our facilities are dedicated to improve water efficiency, such as detecting and repairing water leaks, or recalibrating flow meters. There's also a water assessment in our Johnson Controls Manufacturing System (JCMS) Maturity Model within the Environment and Sustainability principle. A project example, would be how our York test lab established a team to identify, quantify and assign value for possible water savings opportunities when testing chillers for leaks using water. Ways to recycle the test water were identified resulting in an annual of about 456,600 gallons  Our current goal is to reduce our water intensity by 5% by 2020 from a 2014 baseline.
Our global facilities identify energy efficiency and water conservation projects and through the use of the Best Business Practice/Continuous Improvement (BBP/CI) management system, they track and manage improvement projects at their facility. We also leverage these tools to run reports for all energy efficiency and water conservation projects being implemented globally. Although our water costs are lower than our energy costs, reducing our water use also reduces our water costs and presents additional operational savings to our business.
Performance contracting is basically receiving a guaranteed energy and water savings to offset facility and infrastructure renewal project costs. It allows customers to make capital improvements, save energy and water, reduce emissions, improve sustainability and address tight budgets â€“ and use the expected utility and operational savings to offset the cost of the upgrades.  The savings are guaranteed, so risks to the customer are minimal.  We see a growing opportunity to meet customersâ€™ resource efficiency needs, including water efficiency.  Currently our total Building Efficiency business across all products and services represents 28% of our enterprise revenue.

We see a growing opportunity to meet customersâ€™ resource efficiency needs, including water efficiency.  Currently our total Building Efficiency business across all products and services represents 28% of our enterprise revenue.
This customer project helps reduce both water and energy consumption. Johnson Controls together with Affiliated Engineers, Inc., helped Stanford engineers deliver a custom-engineered heat-recovery process that is 70 percent more efficient than the cogeneration process Stanford used since 1987. York heat-recovery chillers will meet more than 90 percent of campus heating demands by capturing almost two-thirds of the waste heat generated by the campus cooling system to produce hot water for the heating system. Along with a Metasys building automation system, Johnson Controls developed the Enterprise Optimization System, a predictive control software system to optimize cost and energy use based on the 10 day weather forecast and future grid electricity prices. The software is designed to predict hourly campus heating and cooling needs, and then determine how to best run the heat recovery, heating, and cooling equipment inside. It also will determine how much hot and cold water to store in the CEF's water thermal storage tanks for later use. While it is a fact that our water conservation efforts for customers are still smaller when compared to our energy conservation business, we have seen a growing demand for them.

Our SiG program has been underway since 2010 and had resulted in an absolute water reduction of 18% from our 2007 baseline by the end of 2015. We missed our short-term water goal to reduce usage in our direct operations by 25% by 2015, from 2007 levels. We also know that water is a local resource and simply reducing usage everywhere is not the most effective way to limit our impact. Going forward, we will change our focus to centre on locations where water is scarce and the associated business risks are greatest.

Better Understanding theRelationship of Irrigationon Modern HybridsMonsanto releases new corn hybrids annuallythat are incrementally better than previousproducts in several ways, includingproduction volume at harvest, insectresistance, herbicide tolerance, grainquality, plant health and stress tolerance.To show the progress of hybrids overtime, research trials were planted at theMonsanto Learning Center at Gothenburg,Nebraska, to test the effects of drought oncorn hybrids from the 1970s, 1990s andtoday. Three different types of irrigationlevels were evaluated. Results from thisstudy indicate the modern-day corn seed â€“GenuityÂ® DroughtGardÂ® Hybrids with VTDouble PROÂ®, RIB CompleteÂ® Corn Blendâ€“ produced significantly more grain acrossall water environments than the olderhybrids. In addition, significant root lodgingoccurred in the older hybrids, which affectedtheir harvest, while the modern-day hybridshad minimal root lodging.The Learning Center is located on oneof the most important water resourcesfor agriculture in the United States, theOgallala Aquifer. Because half the landthere needs to be irrigated, while theother half doesnâ€™t, this location is ideal forstudying water issues and management.
Better Understanding theRelationship of Irrigationon Modern HybridsMonsanto releases new corn hybrids annuallythat are incrementally better than previousproducts in several ways, includingproduction volume at harvest, insectresistance, herbicide tolerance, grainquality, plant health and stress tolerance.To show the progress of hybrids overtime, research trials were planted at theMonsanto Learning Center at Gothenburg,Nebraska, to test the effects of drought oncorn hybrids from the 1970s, 1990s andtoday. Three different types of irrigationlevels were evaluated.

We offer data science-based digital tools to provide insights that support farmers as they make decisions throughout the growing season. The Climate Corporation, a division of Monsanto,offers Climate FieldViewâ„¢, an integratedplatform that helps farmers sustainably increase productivity with digital tools. The platform brings together data science, predictive analytics, integrated seed science, field science, local weather monitoring and data modeling to develop customized insights both field by fieldand in specific locations within a given field. In addition to helping farmers have better harvests, many of the insights provided by Climate FieldViewâ„¢ enable them to improve profitability by making better informed operating and financing  decisions and use resources like nutrients, pesticides and water more efficiently. One of the most costly inputs and  important activities that farmers do every year is manage nitrogen fertilizer applications.  Nitrogen helps farmers achieve better harvests by adding a necessary nutrient to the soil. But the chemistry of nitrogen provides several challenges that farmers must also address. Nitrogen fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that can contribute to climate change, and can sometimes be lost to waterways if applied just before a heavy rain. The Climate Corporation offers the Nitrogen Advisor digital tool, which helps farmers optimize the amount of nitrogen they use on their fields.

NRG acquired a 25.65 MW solar project on the Island of Guam from Quantum Guam Power Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned affiliate of Quantum Utility Generation LLC.To help alleviate the Pacific island from the volatility of unpredictable fuel prices and availability, we will construct, own and operate the solar project, which will sell all of its power output to the Guam Power Authority (GPA). We will relieve the island of its dependency on imported residual fuel oil and diesel for its power. Estimates for the project predict that the solar solution will offset the consumption of almost 2 million barrels of residual fuel oil and diesel â€“ minimizing Guam's carbon footprint.

Decreased water use not only decreases our intake costs, but also decreases costs associated with treating water to meet our quality standards and discharging costs. Using an appropriate average cost of water for our industry and global nature of our company- if we were to reduce our water use by 10% (from 2015 levels) our potential savings for water intake alone would be over $2 million. One of our plants has decreased their absolute municipal water use by over 35% since 2010 through leak detection, more efficient equipment, and increased metering with an automated alert system if water use falls out of certain parameters, These measures resulting in an intake savings of approximately $49,000 in 2015. This does not include any associated discharge or processing savings.

Conserving water is good for our business and the environment wherever we operate. By the end of 2015, we had reduced our water use per unit of production by 25.8% since 2006 from our legacy operations, exceeding our target of a 20 percent reduction and delivering a cost saving of approximately $19 million in 2015 as compared to a 2006 run rate. Our total water use fell from 95.8 million cubic meters in 2014 to 92.7 million cubic meters in 2015.
PepsiCo worked with our U.K. farmers to achieve a 50 percent reduction in agricultural carbon emissions of key growers and the water impact of key growers who operate in water-stressed areas by the end of 2015. Data for 2015 is not yet available. New varieties, investment in technology such as drip irrigation, and the data and information available through i-cropTM and Cool Farm Tool technologies provide confidence that our growers will meet this challenging target.
Our ability to achieve our goals is possible in part by collaborating with business, academic experts and NGOs. We are actively involved in the UN Global Compactâ€™s CEO Water Mandate, the WBCSD water leadership group, the International Finance Corporationâ€™s 2030 Water Resources Group and the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable. These forums allow us to learn from other companies and share our own experiences across a spectrum of industries, including food and beverage manufacturing, power generation and construction. This also enables us to discuss water-related issues and advance solutions on a pre-competitive basis.

Cost savings can be achieved through improvements in water efficiency, conservation and recycling at PMI manufacturing facilities which are driven by a water reduction program. Though these opportunities are not currently considered substantial in relation to PMIâ€™s operations, revenue or expenditure, opportunities are still sought and targeted throughout our business. As an example, since 2010, our Quebec facility has decreased its water consumption by over 79% - by the end of 2015 it saved more than 300,000 m3 of water. The main project that led to this reduction was the implementation of closed loop cooling systems.

APS's closure of coal units (820 megawatts retired since 2013) has resulted in the reduction of water consumption by approximately 20%. We expect to retire an additional 767 megawatts of coal by 2025, which we project to further reduce water consumption at the Cholla Power Plant to less than 10% of current consumption. Shift in load from coal to natural gas will result in significant water savings as the water intensity (gallons/megawatt hour) at our gas plants is less than half of the coal plant water intensity. Continued development of renewable energy such as PV solar and wind will reduce fleet wide water intensity and when combined with reduction in coal generation plus the retirement of steam units at Ocotillo and replaced with more efficient combustion turbines, APS expects fleet wide water intensity reductions of 20% by 2025.
APS investment in water for the future includes purchase of effluent under contracts through 2050 for Palo Verde and Red Hawk, to be extended if needed.  It also includes purchase of long term storage credits from the Gila River Indian Community to supply high priority water to the Sundance Power Plant.
Retirement of steam units at Ocotillo and replaced with more efficient combustion turbines, cooled by hybrid cooling will reduce water consumption significantly.  Water intensity will improve from 1000 g/mwh to 100 g/mwh.
APS established a Well and Pumping Equipment Reliability Program in 2015 that encompasses critical components of the water supply, including groundwater wells, well testing and inspection, pump testing, well infrastructure inspection (including pumps and motors, meters and lubrication systems).
In 2015, Well Field Management Plans were developed for a portion of the fleet and are being implemented, tested, and revised.  These plans will result in more efficient use of higher quality groundwater, decreased water consumption, and more strategic use of water resources.
Improving water infrastructure and distribution management is an important part of our Smart Cities and Internet of Everything vision. Saipan is a U.S. territory in the Northern Mariana Islands with 40,000 residents and until recently a challenging water situation. The island was losing 70% of its potable water due to leaky pipes and theft. To improve the system, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands enlisted the help of CH2M Hill. The engineering company collaborated with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. to develop M2M technology that keeps track of the water supplyâ€™s movement throughout the system, and more importantly, where itâ€™s being lost. The M2M solution includes cellular-based meters, tank level monitors, and pressure sensors, all using the QualcommÂ® Gobiâ„¢ modem to connect to fast, reliable wireless networks. The new system will enable Saipan to conserve water, saving $750K for each 10% reduction. The goal is to reduce loss associated with theft and leaking pipes by two-thirds over the next five years, which will save the community millions of dollars in energy costs, provide higher quality of water, and ensure that everyone receives water 24 hours a day. Water utilities across the U.S. and its territories have an average of 30% loss, with some as high as 70%, an amount that can make a critical difference in an emergency situation.
Qualcomm has piloted projects that demonstrate the positive role mobile technologies can play in water-related issues. Specifically, Qualcomm Wireless Reach has mobile fishing programs in India, Brazil, Colombia and Senegal. The Fishing with Mobile Nets program uses advanced wireless technologies, digital content and a virtual community platform to promote the economic and social development of traditional fishermen, women and youth in vulnerable villages in Colombia.  The program provides participants with 3G or 4G LTE connected tablets and smartphones as well as customized applications and training to support mobile education, improved business practices and the development of new economic activities. The overall goal is to reduce poverty by raising productivity and income in these underserved communities. The program has been so successful that the Ministry of Information Communications Technology has made a commitment to replicate this program in additional communities across Colombia. The Wireless Solutions for Fishery program in Senegal, currently implemented in Mbour and Mballing, two key artisanal fishing communities, uses advanced wireless technologies to improve lives by offering access to things like wave height and weather information, market prices, microfinance and healthcare resources.

In our home state of California, where the bulk of our customers reside, water and energy are typically managed separately despite the important links between the two. Water is used in the production of nearly every major energy source. Likewise, energy is used in multiple ways and at multiple steps in water delivery and treatment systems as well as wastewater collection and treatment. As a result, utilities receive financial incentives for the successful implementation of energy-efficiency programs that often reduce water use as well, through energy and water-efficient appliances and equipment. To the extent our customers become more focused on reducing energy and water use, this provides our California utilities with more opportunities to save natural resources and earn financial incentives, as available.
Sempra has taken many steps to minimize water use in our operations. This includes using reclaimed water and dry-cooling at our power plants and photovoltaic cells made that convert sunlight directly into electricity without the use of water. As water becomes an increasingly scarce resource and Sempra and its business units are recognized for taking action to reduce water use, this can positively impact our reputation, making it easier to do business and get new projects permitted and approved.
Our SDG&E and SoCalGas business units are reducing water use at employee-occupied facilities through equipment upgrades, in addition to water-saving measures for landscaping, including drought-tolerant plants and weather-based irrigation. We also utilize water-saving technologies for power generation, including photovoltaic cells that generate electricity from sunlight without using water.  When we save water, we also reduce energy use, further reducing costs and impacts to the environment.

In 2012 Union Pacific created a position dedicated to the conservation of utilities net-work wide.  The "Project Manager of Utility Management" manages a Utility Software Application that captures withdrawal data from more than 1,100 active municipal water accounts. The data helps locate trends which lead to identification of underground leaks, conservation project opportunities and aids in increasing engagement.  In addition, the Project Manager leads â€œUtility Conservation Huntsâ€ throughout the year at the facility level.  During the â€œUtility Conservation Huntâ€ at our North Little Rock Locomotive Shop, teams installed PLC devices to reduce the operating time of multiple large industrial parts washers.  This reduced the amount of new water required in the washing process.  Total 2015 water withdrawal at this facility was reduced 3% year over year.

UP managed change in precipitation extremes and drought by employing the use of its available surge resources, adjusted transportation plans to use alternate switching yards, and gateways and repositioned resources to where they were most needed to increase velocity.
In some locations, Union Pacific maintains water wells to nourish vegetation that serves as a wind break for operations. Wind breaks reduce locomotive fuel consumption and resulting emissions and reduce maintenance required to clear the track and switches from blowing sand.

In 2012 Union Pacific created a position dedicated to the conservation of utilities net-work wide.  The "Project Manager of Utility Management" manages a Utility Software Application that captures withdrawal data from more than 1,100 active municipal water accounts. The data helps locate trends which lead to identification of underground leaks, conservation project opportunities and aids in increasing engagement.  In addition, the Project Manager leads â€œUtility Conservation Huntsâ€ throughout the year at the facility level.  During the â€œUtility Conservation Huntâ€ at our North Little Rock Locomotive Shop, teams installed PLC devices to reduce the operating time of multiple large industrial parts washers.  This reduced the amount of new water required in the washing process.  Total 2015 water withdrawal at this facility was reduced 3% year over year.

Our customersâ€™ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customersâ€™ energy use could increase or decrease.  Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Weather conditions outside of our service territory could also have an impact on our revenues.  We buy and sell electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities

At the conclusion of 2015, markets representing 85 percent of our new company-owned restaurant construction had integrated Blueline approaches and technologies into their development processes and specifications to deliver LEED certifiable buildings. We expect this cost savings opportunity to grow as Yum! plans to open at least 1,450 net new units in 2016 according to its initial guidance for investors.
As mentioned above, stores built to Yum!â€™s Blueline green building standards realize an average cost savings of $500 per year related to water.
Dedicated resources, including our Chief Sustainability Officer and Global Sustainability team, and our brand and division teams, work together to build brands people trust and champion â€“ this is no different when it comes to water conservation. Our cross functional teams help ensure that we are always working to introduce new technology and initiatives to make restaurants in our local communities better stewards of the natural resources we use to run our stores. For example, our KFC Australia market is very focused on water conservation and introduced water-saving measures including water efficient landscaping, high efficiency water faucets and restroom fixtures, and above ground water tanks. Globally, Australia, China, India, South Africa, Turkey, and USA all have at least one equity store classified as a high risk site that could benefit from improved water stewardship.
Many SRI investors are signatories to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, which represents approximately $60 trillion in assets under management. Many of Yum!â€™s top shareholders belong to this initiative.

The manufacturing of glass containers is not seen as being very sensitive to climate change. For example: We use abundant raw materials (including a lot of recycled glass), are not large users of water, are generally not affected by adverse weather conditions, and are the only material that can be widely refilled. This could translate to increased differentiation among the competition if significant climate changes occur.

Recharge is a means of storing excess renewable water supplies so that they may be used in the future. Artificial recharge and the use of GSFs is an increasingly important tool in the management of Arizonaâ€™s water supplies.  Storing water underground to ensure an adequate supply for the purpose of satisfying current and future needs is both practical and cost-effective in our desert environment.  This exercise also results in reducing current groundwater demands in the state while encouraging the development of beneficial partnerships between various entities across the diverse water use sectors in Arizona.

In December 2015, the U.S. Secretary of Interior Sally Jewel issued a Record of Decision that finalized the Bill Williams Water Rights Settlement Act of 2014 (Act).  The Act provided for a settlement of water rights disputes between the Hualapai Tribe (Tribe), the United States (acting on behalf of the Tribe), Freeport's Bagdad operation, and the State of Arizona's Game and Fish Department in the Bill Williams River watershed in Arizona.  The settlement provides the Tribe with the means to purchase future water supplies to Tribal members. Additionally, the settlement provided for the transfer of a portion of Freeport's Planet Ranch property and water rights to support the Multi-Species Conservation Program (MSCP).  The MSCP is a multi-state mitigation program that sets aside lands for species and habitat conservation to offset water and power operations in the Lower Colorado River Basin.  The settlement further provides each party with protection against future water rights disputes and litigation.  Finally, the settlement secures Freeport's water rights for over 70 percent of Bagdad's make-up water supplies.

Our patented blowdown boilers increase water recycling and we are building them into our facilities. We started reusing clean effluent from our camps wastewater treatment facility to build ice roads and as dust suppression water.  We are now using saline groundwater rather than using fresh surface water from Lake Newell in our conventional operations.
To ensure we are meeting our regulatory requirements around water use in our drilling and exploration programs, we developed and rolled out an innovative new system for tracking our water withdrawals by source and end use.
In our oil sands operations, the steam to oil ratio (or SOR) is an indicator that highlights the water and energy use required. A lower SOR means lower energy use, fewer emissions, lower costs and less water use.We use it as a benchmark of efficiency in our oil sands operations. Cenovus continues to have one of the lowest SORs in our industry. Our low SOR allows us to produce with low energy requirements, low water use and low operating costs.  We are continually pursuing new technologies to further reduce costs and our environmental footprints.
With our continuous investment in both equipment and process changes within our production operations, Pinnacle will continue to gain and advantage of our competitors through more efficient use of our resources and therefore, lower operational costs.

Project planning complete for project to decrease source water use in the United States.
We think holistically around our entire lifecycle and our fully-integrated approach to systems, storage and software is fundamentally enabling more sustainability benefits.As an example of this, SunPower acquired Greenbotics Inc., a company that uses robots to clean solar panels at utility-scale installations. These robots have been introduced across the SunPower utility-scale portfolio and use up to 90 percent less water than traditional cleaning methods. We expect this to result in hundreds of thousands of gallons of water savings each year. We are also actively investing in R&D at Greenbotics with the hope that there are more water reductions still to come.What we do will certainly not end with Greenbotics as we are actively piloting new approaches to thinking holistically about water use associated with our product. Currently, we are exploring how the siting of our solar panels might be used as a groundwater recharge system to capture and store rainwater especially in arid agricultural regions.

In 2015 alone, we invested more than $60,000 in 34 voluntary projects that reduced annual water usage estimated at 258 megaliters. The investments in these projects saved us an estimated $250,000 in operating costs.  At one facility we installed a system to capture the condensate water from our Make-up Air Units for use as cooling tower make-up water and for landscaping.  Another site recycles water from glass washers to the cooling towers and then recycles the cooling tower discharge water back through the cooling tower until it no longer meets quality standards.  Several sites recycle deionized reject water for use in other onsite processes.
Smokey Mountain is one of the largest and most desperate slums in Manila. It has grown around the cityâ€™s 17-acre dumpsite where 10,000 people live as scavengers, surviving without reliable access to safe drinking water, healthy food or electricity. Future stations can house a variety of applications that include charging stations, water purification systems, information technology and entertainment resources, to name a few.

Needs for clear water continue to grow worldwide. Technologies capable of providing solutions to the population and communities will be increasingly requested, our investment plan matches this opportunity for growth.
Water treatment requires chemicals and energy which cost can be reduced if we need to purchase and consume less. For facilities outsourcing water treatment, the lower the volume, the lower the cost. Our French sites will be certified Under the ISO50001 standards. The energy maagement system is going to help us acting on all the significant energy uses including water treatment.
Our customers actively engage in sustainability initiatives, for example they actively support reforestation initiatives and special care about water use in their supply chain. Our contribution to this global effort consists in applying responsible procurement principles and buy our main raw material (wood pulp) from suppliers demonstrating their commitment to the environment (FSC, PEFC certified). We have stated this commitment through our SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY POLICY (see attachment in the section "further information")
KPIs and Case studies are published to inform our employees (i.e. share success achieved on one site with all the corporation, benchmark with good external practices, ect.). Events are organized to mobilize people (i.e. visit of WWTP during the annual â€œSustainability Weekâ€ across the corporation). Also our employees participate in our Operational Excellence program, a program for continuous improvement through cross-functional working groups and application of statistical methods.
We believe engagement with stakeholders is of very high importance especially for long-term impacts such as the management of water resource. We participate in workshops and round tables upon invitation of the Policy makers in some of our operations, where relevant.
We have signed a cooperation agreement with an energy producer who has installed turbines in a dam we own and operate for water control for our French operation on river Salat. As this Partner is using our infrastructure, the agreement states that some pay-back revenue is to be returned to us.

There are several processes in which Delta Beverages could reduce water consumption resulting in cost savings. Improvements could be made to increase the efficiency of steam/condensate recovery systems in order to reduce make-up water required by the boilers used to generate process steam. Another area that could be improved to reduce water consumption is a cooling tunnel system which spray relatively cold water on bottles containing hot beverage product in order to bring down the temperature. The current system is an open-loop design in which fresh cold water is continuously sprayed onto the bottles

Saving on water consumption and discharge bills contributes directly to the companyâ€™s bottom line.
Many of our facilities already have sub-metering stations, where we are actively tracking our water consumption to identify potential savings.
Our new buildings will serve as a model for all future buildings and drive innovation within our existing facilities to achieve company-wide water reductions.  As more of our buildings use low flow fixtures, we are recognizing lower operating costs per employee.  At our new buildings 8 & 9 at our Tarrytown, New York location that opened during 2015, we achieved more than a 40% reduction of water use over code due to the plumbing fixtures installed.

Many of our operations sites are in process of planning or installing wastewater treatment systems for our waterborne wash and other water-based wastes. The treated water is planned initially for discharge to WWTP but there are future plans for reuse into process water systems and ultimately, back into our product. This will take time to implement and to realize water use reduction,

The projects identified during the assessment phase are captured/documented and ranked according to their potential for water and financial saving opportunities, capital/investment requirements and long-term, strategic fit. Capital dollars are available to invest in technology upgrades that would drive increased water performance. Being able to manage our manufacturing water resources in an effective way is part of our commitment to be a responsible corporate citizen and attain our sustainability targets.

In 2016, Altria concluded our five-year environmental goals, including a goal to achieve 50 percent water neutrality by offsetting our water use through on-site treatment programs and conservation, and by enacting conservation efforts in the communities in which we operate through our grant partnerships. In 2016, we exceeded this goal with 54.9 percent water neutrality. Exceeding this target led to improved water efficiency and strengthened our social license to operate. In 2016, we set new long-term environmental goals including continuing the target of 50 percent water neutrality by 2025. Altria's overall water consumption decreased 10.6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. Through ongoing water stewardship efforts including on-site water treatment and the company's support of non-profit conservation efforts, Altria conserved 1,126 million gallons of water while treating 241 million gallons of water in 2016. Altria supports the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's work in the Columbia River, Cumberland Plateau, and Chesapeake Bay watersheds which helps protect and restore some of the most important ecosystems in the nation. Part of the risks these ecosystems face is due to water quality and quantity issues. These issues continue to be identified and monitored by grantees of NFWF's programs, and inform Altria's understanding of how to continue to direct environmental contributions resources in the communities in which we live and work.

Water stress in the western U.S. and changing regulations present two opportunities for AEP to benefit from market opportunities.  In the west, trading water rights with farmers may be an effective alternative to finding new sources of water.  It is often more cost effective for a farmer to sell water rights, if only for one year, than to grow crops that may fail.  AEP would benefit from access to necessary water at a lower cost than developing new water sources.  In the east, new regulations are resulting in the closure of many once-thru cooled power plants.  AEP's water withdrawals and consumption have dropped dramatically since 2015 greatly reducing the company's exposure to water issues.

We have developed water maps for each  of our sites (water maps for newly included or recently acquired sites are currently in development) following the flow of water through the site to its exit point. Through these evaluations we are able to characterize all points of water use, identify significant water users, and develop performance indicators. These water maps are already providing opportunities and benefits to better understand usage and identify reduction opportunities.

Innovative water recycling and delivery systems have reduced costs in operations. For example in Colorado, a â€œwater on demandâ€ system has reduced the impact on the community of trucking water, reduced water usage and reduced costs. By constructing 60+ miles (FYI_ OVER 150 miles in Colorado alone) of pipelines, there are 96% fewer trucks on the road and 88% fewer storage tanks.
The increase of water reuse and recycling systems is resulting in improved water efficiency. For example, in Utah, a completions system creates temporary staging sites on existing well sites to treat and recycle flow back water, then move it to the next operation for reuse.

We believe that bond issuances are one of the best tools for organizations to finance climate adaptation. This is an opportunity for us to provide additional products and services. Green bonds are fixed income, liquid financial instruments for raising debt capital for climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives and were created to access the $100 trillion bond market and expanding the investor base for climate projects. We have been a leader in developing the green bond market since it began a decade ago. We worked with peers to develop the Green Bond Principles to ensure credibility, were the first firm to issue a benchmark sized green bond, and have led the market in underwriting. We estimate the potential implication of this opportunity to be over $20 billion of annual business activity.We manage this opportunity via our green bonds business. We have grown our Debt Capital Markets team focused on green bonds to four people, and we are educating our relationship bankers to be able to offer this tool to our clients. In 2016, we issued our third and largest corporate green bond for $1 billion. Bloomberg New Energy Finance recognized us as the number one underwriter of green bonds for the past three years and we led the underwriting of $25 billion in green bonds on behalf of 27 clients in 2016. In 2016, we served as green structuring agent, joint bookrunner and joint lead manager on MTR Corporation Limitedâ€™s inaugural $600M green bond, including financing water management.
Factors including increased understanding and awareness about climate change and its causes and effects, as well as policy, reputational and financial factors are driving increased client demand for our low-carbon products and services. Opportunities exist across our lines of business.We estimate that changing client and client demand for low-carbon financing represents an opportunity for $125 billion in additional business for us from 2013 to 2025. This represents the lending, equipment finance, capital markets and advisory activities, and carbon markets finance to clients around the world to be delivered through our current $125 billion initiative. As an illustration of this opportunity, increasing client demand helped us deliver $15.9 billion towards our environmental business initiative in 2016.This includes $948 million towards water-related projects.  For example, in April 2016, we served as sole green structuring agent, joint bookrunner and billing & delivery agent for Banco Nacional de Costa Ricaâ€™s inaugural Green Bond ($500 million) financing renewable energy projects including wind, solar and hydroelectric energy projects that are less than or equal to 50 MW of installed capacity and waste water treatment projects. Additionally, we served as lead bookrunner on Massachusetts Clean Water Trustâ€™s $208M green bond to fund wastewater infrastructure and drinking water infrastructure projects.
We believe that bond issuances are one of the best tools for organizations to finance climate adaptation. This is an opportunity for us to provide additional products and services. Green bonds are fixed income, liquid financial instruments for raising debt capital for climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives and were created to access the $100 trillion bond market and expanding the investor base for climate projects. We have been a leader in developing the green bond market since it began a decade ago. We worked with peers to develop the Green Bond Principles to ensure credibility, were the first firm to issue a benchmark sized green bond, and have led the market in underwriting. We estimate the potential implication of this opportunity to be over $20 billion of annual business activity.We manage this opportunity via our green bonds business. We have grown our Debt Capital Markets team focused on green bonds to four people, and we are educating our relationship bankers to be able to offer this tool to our clients. In 2016, we issued our third and largest corporate green bond for $1 billion. Bloomberg New Energy Finance recognized us as the number one underwriter of green bonds for the past three years and we led the underwriting of $25 billion in green bonds on behalf of 27 clients in 2016. In 2016, we served as green structuring agent, joint bookrunner and joint lead manager on MTR Corporation Limitedâ€™s inaugural $600M green bond, including financing water management.

Reduced capital and operating costs by increasing the use of recycled water onsite instead of discharging it, thereby reducing water treatment requirements, water withdrawals and associated costs. In 2016, five Barrick operations were zero discharge sites with all water recycled and reused. The remaining 45%, mostly located in wet climates, released treated water to the environment. Sites which are operated as zero discharge reuse all water that potentially come in contact with the mine disturbed areas. This removes the cost to construct and operate additional water extraction or water treatment facilities for discharge. For example, Barrickâ€™s Veladero mine in Argentina has become a zero discharge facility since 2013 by recycling treated domestic wastewater for operational water usage.
Continue to invest in R&D of new technologies using alternative water sources for metal extraction processing with the objective to reduce the need for capital and operational costs for water treatment and water supply.  This will position Barrick to be a leader in mineral processing technologies. Develop new technologies to incorporate sea water into processing. We developed a new technology, an Air-Metabisulfite treatment (AMBS), which enables the copper flotation process to use seawater, saline or brackish water with minimal metallurgical impact compared to fresh or desalinated water. This improves metallurgy significantly (compared to a lime process) and allows us to reduce potential energy requirements, if water treatment was previously required.
Baxter considers several factors to identify water usage reduction opportunities and possible water conservation projects at sites, including total water used, water usage efficiency, and water cost and availability. Due to the strong link between energy usage and water processing, optimizing water systems remains a key focus of the companyâ€™s facility energy assessments.

The opportunity to increase capital availability is currently being re-evaluated because of proven savings from energy conservation and buying strategies implemented in since 2008.  Our strategy to capitalize on these opportunities is through formal public targets (a 40% reduction normalized to COGS in water consumption as part of our Sustainability 2020 Goals) as well as a dedicated $5 million capital budget for projects with a positive sustainability benefit.  The financial implications of this opportunity vary from year to year but range from  $300,000-$10 million annual savings across the portfolio (depending on if there are energy savings as part of a water project).  As a case study of this, 5 projects implemented in 2016 have annual cost savings of approximately $96,900.

Addressing issues related to quality of wastewater discharges with concerned stakeholders provides opportunities to positively influence NGOs and consumer attitudes and to improve Carnivalâ€™s image with existing and potential customers for our cruises.
Equipment manufacturers are willing to subsidize the cost of the new equipment when we offer a ship for pilot testing.  Investments and operational costs associated with this testing include the active involvement of shipboard personnel, who track and monitor the results of these tests.
Improvements that result in lower water consumption directly result in reduced quantities of produced waste water and associated reductions in discharges from the ships.
There is a higher operational cost related to enforcing standards that are more stringent than current regulations.  However, such efforts would result in compliance with stringent future regulations without disruption to the ship if it is required to upgrade its current equipment.

The concentration of our products (removal of water from our products without any formulation changes) makes us less dependent on water as a manufacturing input into our supply chain. This would put Clorox at a competitive advantage vs. others who might be more dependent on the availability of water. We invest in capital and infrastructure to promote water efficiency. Capital investments fund projects to help us reach our 2020 water reduction goals. We also improve efficiency through engaging our employees in conserving water.
Cloroxâ€™s commitment to provide bleach and other key disinfecting products to populations in areas where natural disasters have occurred is very critical to the general health and well-being of people in these areas, particularly bleach donations that support the disinfection of microbiologically contaminated water supplies that often occur following natural disasters. In addition, the company has been supporting the Clorox Safe Water Project in rural Peru since 2012, partnering with a local NGO to implement a bleach-based intervention to treat microbiologically unsafe drinking water on an ongoing basis.  These public health interventions also provide the Clorox Company reputational value. In addition, we set public sustainability goals which include water reduction and share these goals through our annual report and on our public Corporate Responsibility website. Sharing these goals, which include water reduction, enhances our brand value by demonstrating to our consumers that sustainability is a key business initiative.
We have conducted water audit workshops globally to enable our manufacturing locations to get more efficient in the way they use process water, and recycle and re-use water where possible.

Water has and will continue to be an important resource in electric generation. It is used to generate steam to turn a turbine. Additionally, water is used for condenser cooling at our gas and coal-fired units. Consumers Energy understands the significance of the Great Lakes and their impact on our business. Having these abundant water resources available to our operations allows the company to efficiently operate. We intend to continue to protect and preserve the Great Lakes while using them to fulfill our operational needs. If we did not have access to a water source Consumers Energyâ€™s generating units would not be able to operate. Wise management of this resource and disclosure of management efforts aligns with shareholder interests.

The Clean Water Act Part 316(b) regulations require management of entrainment and impingement of fish and larvae at cooling water intake structures. The off-shore intake structure at JH Campbell unit 3, the largest coal-fired unit in the fleet, was built to take advantage of the depth and temperatures of Lake Michigan for cooling. This intake structure is already compliant with the 316(b) regulations. The Company will take advantage of this technology to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the regulations. This strategy will be implemented through submission of required reports under the NPDES permit within the next year. The financial implications are such that zero capital cost will be incurred for this unit. If this intake technology were not present, new, compliant intakes or cooling towers could be required, costing $50 million or more.
Colgate has an opportunity to improve our efficiency and reduce our water use in order to realize cost savings. To realize this opportunity, Colgate embedded it into our  2015 to 2020 Sustainability Strategy. Our 2020 goal to reduce our manufacturing water intensity by half compared to 2002. To implement this strategy, Colgate invests in water conservation strategies at our global facilities via our manufacturing capital program and by implementing our Water Stewardship Standard. Our 5% for the Planet program sets a global goal to spend 5 percent of our manufacturing capital expenditure budget on energy reduction, water conservation and reduction of waste to landfill. Financial implications: Since 2011, we have invested nearly $174.8 million in over 1,020 planet-related projects, which have delivered an estimated savings of over $48 million. In 2016, we invested 1.4% of our capital expenditure budget in water-related projects, yielding an estimated $700,000 in annual savings.  We drive water stewardship action at our sites through a program called theâ€œTop 10 Water Actions:1) Water Data Validation2) Water Stewardship Plan3) Water Conservation Assessment4) Water Balance5) Plant Water Systems6) Sanitary and Domestic Water Use7) Cooling Towers8) Cleaning & Sanitization9) Landscaping & Irrigation10) Water Reuse/RecycleBy year-end 2016 our global sites achieved an average completion rate of 94 percent of these actions, with the balance to be finalized in early 2017.

Our strategy is grounded in the business case established through our comprehensive risk assessment (described earlier in this response). That strategy starts with end-to-end water resource sustainability across our value chain from our agricultural ingredient supply chain, plant operations (water efficiency/reuse, stormwater management, and wastewater treatment), customer engagement, and through to consumer engagement. The strategy also takes us outside our value chain and into shared watersheds, communities where we operate and the governance and policy environment that regulates water.

Conagra Brands 2020 Sustainability Vision includes a goal to reduce water use by 20% per pound of product produced.  The water reduction goal has provided incentive to implement water projects to more efficiently use water while driving cost out of our operations. To help us realize this opportunity, the Sustainability team hosts the annual Sustainable Development Awards to recognize our top sustainability achievements. One of four categories included annually in Conagra Brands internal Sustainable Development Awards is Water Conservation and Wastewater Management.  Water projects implemented in 2016 resulted in an annual cost savings of over one million dollars and over 245 million gallons of water conserved. For example, a winning project from our frozen foods facility in Council Bluffs, Iowa saved 24.7 million gallons by reducing excess water used in the sauce-cooling process.

CONSOL Energy treats and discharges over 11 billion gallons of coal mining influenced water annually.  Natural gas production uses large volumes of water to hydraulically fracture horizontal shale gas wells. In addition to reuse of mine influenced water, we promote recycling of water produced during E&P operations within our company as well as externally through third party water sales. We believe these activities can be mutually combined to the benefit of the company, to gas producers in the region, and to the environment.  This can occur by utilizing treated mine water in combination with freshwater and flowback water used in gas operations to reduce freshwater needs for gas production.
In 2014, CONSOL Energy was certified for the first time by the Center for Responsible Shale Development (CRSD), confirming our conformance with all 15 CRSD standards.  CONSOL Energy has shown that in 15 critical areas, its Appalachian Basin operations meet or exceed state and federal air and water management regulatory requirements.  In 2016, CONSOL underwent an annual recertification audit to measure our ongoing conformance to the CRSD standards.  More details regarding CRSD can be found at www.responsibleshaledevelopment.org.

Facilities are asked to brainstorm ways to conserve water at their specific location, and provide the estimated costs associated with the implementation of improved water efficiency measures. We understand that water reduction initiatives are not one size fits all. We understand that innovative water efficiency measures should lead to an overall cost savings. We will continue to focus on opportunities to reduce water withdrawal to minimize the risk associated with water scarcity from extreme weather conditions globally. During FY17, more than $3 million USD was spent on water-related CAPEX projects focusing on water efficiency.
In addition to improving our water use efficiency, costs savings are an added benefit to implementing water use reduction projects and initiatives. We are working to implement water efficiency projects at our facilities with a heightened focus at our locations that have experienced unpredictable weather patterns recently.

Ingredion has developed an environmental conservation strategy to reduce water use intensity 10% by 2020 from a baseline of 2010. This strategy has been implemented and is allowing us to track and realize the opportunity of and track water savings initiatives, which leads to cost savings, improved community relations, and improved water efficiency. For example, upgrades to existing wastewater treatment facilities, recovery of several wastewater streams including CPV, condensate, and steam (which also are used as heat recovery and energy savings), and reuse of treated wastewater for cooling towers. Each 1% reduction in water use intensity results in savings of approximately $250,000 annually.

Our facility in Sesto developed a comprehensive water balance model using about 45 new water meters installed to better understand the correlation between water consumption and production ramp up. Process changes and reduced water use in cleaning operations (shorter cycles) resulted in a reduction of 26,800 L of wastewater per year. The facility is now looking to replicate the water saving initiatives in other facility manufacturing lines. In addition, continuous monitoring of phosphorus concentrations, an automated treatment system, and optimization of a wastewater neutralization system reduced the amount of phosphorus in the facility's wastewater by 54%.

We know that we canâ€™t meet our safety and environmental goals without engaging local stakeholders and Indigenous communities. Be it an oil or natural gas pipeline or a wind farm, energy infrastructure can attract public debate and concern from a variety of perspectives. In order to meet the changing expectations and requirements of local stakeholders and Indigenous communities, businesses such as ours must demonstrate their commitment to including them in how we manage the environmental, social and economic risks and benefits of our investment. Because of the long-lived and linear nature of much of our infrastructure, our management frameworks and systems for engagement are evolving to take a life-cycle view of our assets. We engage early and regularly with local communities on our projects and operations to obtain and respond to their input. Because of the strength of their connection with the land and water, our ability to establish long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with Indigenous communities is a key priority.Indigenous socio-economic participation is one of the key areas in our Indigenous Engagement Program. We have long recognized that hiring Indigenous businesses and contractors supports local employment, gives us the opportunity to understand available services and talent, and helps us build trust and relationships.

In North Dakota, we conducted a pilot project in 2016 to evaluate the use of temporary above ground pipelines to move water from the water source to the wellsite for our hydraulic fracturing operations.  Typically, water is hauled to the site by water tankers. We saw many positive results from the pilot project including: a significant reduction in the number of trucks using local roads; decreased road noise and dust; reduction in vehicle emissions; less impacts to wildlife.

While energy security and climate change have been important drivers for renewable energy adoption, water security provides an additional driver. The energy-water nexus associated with traditional energy sources is a growing concern particularly in water-stressed regions. Unlike thermal electric power plants and CSP, solar PV does not require any water to generate electricity during operation and is therefore ideally suited to meet the growing energy and water needs of arid, water-limited regions. In addition, First Solarâ€™s fully integrated thin film solar module manufacturing process requires less energy, water and semiconductor material than conventional crystalline silicon PV's batch manufacturing process. On a life cycle basis, First Solarâ€™s thin film modules use up to 300 times less water per MWh than conventional energy and up to 12 times less water than other solar technologies.Increased water demand and drought is generating a need for desalinating seawater which presents a new market opportunity for solar PV and First Solar in the Middle East and Australia. While conventional desalination is an energy-intensive process, using PV to power the desalination process can decarbonize the process significantly. At the Greenough River Solar Farm in Australia, for example, First Solar PV modules are being used to offset the energy requirements of a desalination plant south of Perth.

Our Flex 20 by 2020 employee actions offer an opportunity for staff retention due to the company sustainability efforts. In particular, there is an action to use energy and water in a responsible manner, identify saving opportunities in the workplace, report leaks, and share ideas to Operations management, Facilities and/or EHS departments. This action join to operations water saving projects and programs will let the company achieve the water reduction goal and at the same time helps to increase our employee engagement.
Manufacturing sustainability programs during new program review require the evaluation of new technologies suchas electrolytic softening toincrease cooling tower cyclesof concentration, thus loweringwater consumption.The new technologies save water and are targeted at locations with water stress and risk issues. Our Powertrain and Vehicle Operations divisions have developed tools which evaluate the environmental impacts of new engine, transmission, and vehicleprograms, and determine theoptimum investments to achieve environmental improvement. These toolsexamine the impact of the newprogram on many different environmental media, including water.
We have been working to quantify water consumption over the life of a typical light duty vehicle in the U.S. TheGeorgia Institute of Technologyâ€™s Sustainable Design and Manufacturingprogram recently conducted a literature survey to estimate the water footprint of a typical light-duty vehicle in the U.S.The analysis that Ford conducted included water used in material production, production of parts, assembly, use, and disposal at end-of life.  In the supply chain, the production and processing of metals (in particular steel and aluminum) require the most water. Identifying which portions of the supply chain are most water-intensive allows us to better assess the business risk associated with using different suppliers in potentially water stressed areas.  Information on this analysis appears in Ford's Sustainability Report and is used to inform our efforts with suppliers.
The cost of using water is expected tocontinue to increase in the coming decades. For a manufacturing company like ours, this would mean higher operating costs. Already, in some locations, rate increases from 2000 to 2012 outpaced water reductions, and our costs will continue to rise if we donâ€™t make further improvements. Working on solutions helps us to secure a â€œlicense to operateâ€ in diverse global locations and can enhance our reputation in local communities.Our work on developing new technologies for water stressed areas can be leveraged to save money in other locations. These operations become more viable as the cost of water increases.  Improving water efficiency within our operations reduces usage and wastewater generated, thereby saving the company money.
3-Wet Paint Technology saves water in the painting process at new paint shop installations, which can be heavy water users.This technology enables consolidation of painting activities in an integrated booth, offering the potential to eliminate one booth water wash section, depending on plant design.  3-Wet is being replicated at Ford plants around the globe, including facilities in North America and Asia Pacific.
Dry Paint Overspray System saves water in the painting process, which can be a heavy water user.This system eliminates water usage from the painting process, resulting in an 80 percent water savings for air conditioning/air tempering and 100 percent water savings from paint-over-spray separation, based on production volume of 158,000 units per year.
Ford utilizes a Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) process for machining in certain processes. This saves a substantial amount of water.MQL uses an extremely small amount of oil and water versus conventional wet-machining. For a typical production line of 450,000 vehicles, MQL can save 282,000 gallons of water per year.  This technology is being replicated at Ford powertrain plants around the globe.
Ford is increasing usage of internal water metering to identify additional water saving opportunities, better control water usage by functional area and drive conservation behaviors to the department level.
Cooling towers are one of the biggest users of water at our plants. Weâ€™re using new technologies such as electrolytic water softening to increase cooling tower cycles of concentration, thus lowering water consumption.Ford is pilot testing ways to save water at our cooling towers, which are one of the biggest water users at our plants. Weâ€™re trying new technologies that soften the water so that there are fewer salts to cause equipment scaling. This allows us to reuse the water through the cooling towers many more times before the hardness requires us to bring freshwater in, reducing the amount of freshwater needed for cooling processes and comfort cooling. This technology is being replicated at Ford plants across the globe.
Ford has installed storm water management systems that help with run-off and provide environmental benefits.In 2014, we marked the 10th anniversary of the rebuilt Dearborn Truck Plant, which was hailed as a model of sustainable manufacturing when we rebuilt it in 2004. The facility incorporates stormwater management systems designed to emulate a natural system, including what was then the largest green roof in the world.  Louisville Assembly Plant installed porous pavers for their employee parking lot, which helps with storm water management. The plant received Ford's US/Canada Environmental Leadership Award for this project. Ford's Cuautitlan, Mexico Assembly plant has implemented ecological concrete as well.
In 2013, the CuautitlÃ¡n, Mexico plant won Fordâ€™s Latin America Environmental Leadership Award for an initiative using ecological concrete. The facility replaced the asphalt and parking lots within the plant with ecological concrete, which allows rain to reenter the ground. This recharges the aquifer beneath the plant and helps prevent water scarcity in the city. The plant renovated an area of more than 9,700 square meters with ecological concrete, allowing the absorption of as much as 7.5 million liters of water per year. Not only was the project beneficial for the community, it was also beneficial for Fordâ€™s own bottom line. Ford facilities in Dearborn and Louisville are now using ecological concrete as well. Ford's strategy is to continue replicating the use of ecological concrete in other locations where feasible.  Ecological concrete is less expensive than traditional concrete and is maintenance-free. As a result, this has saved the plant approximately $40,000 a year in maintenance costs.

Contribute to improving health and well-being for the women who make our clothes and live in communities in our sourcing countries by providing training on good water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices in factory and community settings. We believe this can also benefit suppliers and our business by helping to reduce absenteeism and turnover and improve productivity. We developed and integrated a W.A.S.H. curriculum to our P.A.C.E. (Personal Advancement and Career Enhancement) program for advancing women. The program teaches good practices for water usage, sanitation and hygiene that are intended to improve the health, well-being and productivity of women participants, while also providing spillover benefits to their families and communities. P.A.C.E. helps women in garment factories and communities advance through life and job skills training. In FY2016 we entered into a Global Development Alliance with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to expand our P.A.C.E. program with a specific focus on WASH, support access to WASH services and products through finance, and establish two multi-stakeholder water management committees in partnership with two strategic mill partners, in India. We are working with NGO partners CARE, ICRW, Water.org, and ISC to implement the program.

Improve the resilience of our supply chain, reduce costs and gain competitive advantage by helping strategic suppliers to adopt more sustainable production technologies and processes. Suppliers who are investing in low-water or even waterless techniques will have an advantage if water becomes less available, more polluted, or unpredictably regulated. This is particularly applicable to our biggest mill and laundry countries: China, India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh. We are promoting the adoption of best practices and new technologies that enable mills and laundries to more sustainably manage their inputs and outputs by improving water quality, efficiency and conservation. For example, our Athleta brand is already using Drydye, a waterless dyeing technique that uses super-critical CO2 in place of water to dye fabric. Eventually, this could even include shifting to entirely closed-loop or Zero Liquid Discharge systems (we identified 5 ZLD facilities so far through assessments at strategic fabric mills).

During 2016, GEâ€™s strategy to realize this opportunity was carried out through the Water & Process Technologies business, which provides technologies that conserve, clean, recycle and reuse water, and make more water available. For example, our portfolio allows for municipalities and industrial customers to reuse wastewater for additional purposes, such as agricultural and landscape irrigation, groundwater recharge, and other non-potable uses such as heating and cooling. This can further reduce the amount of freshwater required. We are constantly enhancing current products, and we are developing new, even more advanced technologies to help meet water use challenges. Recently, GE Water published a Digital Water white paper to provide a menu of policy options drawing on examples from around the world. Since industrial use is a large part of freshwater consumption, we help our industrial customers solve their greatest water and process challenges, with a focus on providing products and services for the most tough-to-treat situations. An example of our effort to drive innovation in water management is the 2016 announcement of a partnership with MWH Global and Goldman Sachs as part of its Ecomagination partnerships to help increase water reuse worldwide.

Goodyear monitors the water stress situation for each of our global facilities and takes appropriate action. In general, as part of Goodyear's strategy to conserve and recycle water, almost all facilities utilize closed-loop cooling systems when water is used for cooling materials and equipment. Systems are also in place to capture and return process water and steam condensate for reuse, reducing the need for additional fresh water. Cost savings associated with these opportunities are relatively low when compared to the cost savings from other capital expenditures; however, this allows Goodyear to reinvest in future conservation projects. In recent years, our plants in Americana, Brazil; Malaysia; and Aurangabad, India have all invested significantly in infrastructure upgrades and onsite wastewater treatment systems to help conserve water and implement cost savings. As we continue to evaluate the water stress situations in our operations, capital expenditures on wastewater treatment facilities and infrastructure upgrades will be considered in the planning process.
Goodyear analyzes the water stress and consumption at each manufacturing facility. These indicators are factored into future plans and capital expenditures to help improve overall water use at each facility. Capital expenditures have included installing closed-loop systems, onsite wastewater treatment systems, and upgrading infrastructure. Goodyear has also included water efficiency initiatives in the planning process for the new plant in San Lois Potosi, Mexico. This new facility is intended to be a zero-discharge facility with the ability to reuse all process water on site.
Goodyear is committed to caring for the environment, and we believe our long-standing reputation as a responsible corporate citizen helps to increase our brand value. Corporate responsibility is ingrained in our culture.

Caesars is actively looking for additional recycled water connections to our golf courses. With changing attitudes toward recycled water use there has been and will be increased public support for the infrastructure needed to change our golf courses to recycled water. Connecting a golf course to a reclaimed water system costs local municipalities millions of dollars and is the lynchpin in order for Caesars to use recycled water. One golf course in the Las Vegas area uses recycled water saving over 550 megaliters/year. ~$150,000/yr. or a 50% discount could be expected for using recycled water for irrigating the golf course.

Since 2009, our water strategy has focused on reducing our water use by measuring water consumption and translating the data into relevant metrics that Hilton employees, owners and management groups can use to make decisions and set goals that improve performance and create long-term value. To realize this opportunity, Hilton created LightStay, our proprietary sustainability performance measurement platform, and established Brand Standards requiring all hotel brands to report water use along with other quantitative and qualitative data.   Through LightStay, weâ€™ve gathered more than eight years of data across the global portfolio that we use to drive greater efficiencies, save value, and create tools and training for hotels. We compile the data to project anticipated water use and cost impacts in future months, which allows us to start planning how we can play a role in the larger water crisis. We require all hotels to have reduction targets in place and ongoing water improvement projects recorded, which drives continuous improvement, efficiency and learning across our global portfolio. Financial implications: From 2009-2016, Hilton has reduced its normalized water use intensity by 18.4 percent (per ft2/m2 hotel floor area), which likely translates to normalized water cost savings of at least 15%.

Through our global footprint and operations, we see an opportunity to improve hotel laundry efficiency through innovative technologies. To realize this opportunity, Hilton leverages its global footprint to promote investment and adoption of water efficient products and innovative technologies through various channels and vendor partnerships. Hilton has developed several partnerships that offer laundering technologies that can reduce hot water use by up to 45 percent. P&G Tide Coldwaterâ„¢ and Ecolab Aquanomicsâ„¢ are both laundry detergent solutions that eliminate hot water from the wash process and maximize laundry efficiency.  We are also continuing trials with the Xerosâ„¢ polymer bead-based washing system, which uses less water, energy and chemical detergents.  According to Xeros, "Our new polymer bead cleaning technology swaps out up to 80% of the water needed for laundry with small polymer beads. By combining the beadsâ€™ molecular structure with a proprietary detergent solution, dirt from soiled items is attracted and absorbed by the beads, producing cleaner results. Financial implications will vary significantly depending on the hotelâ€™s laundry operations. The attached Xeros case study for the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City Hotel estimates savings over $66,430 based on an 81% reduction in total water and a 100% reduction in hot water use for laundry operations.

The opportunity and strategy to realize opportunity: Sustainable water management is an expectation for our industry. We face challenges in reducing our water use as our manufacturing processes become more complex. In recent years, we have made significant investments in water conservation, expanded disclosure on our water use and conservation eï¬€orts, and engaged with external organizations on emerging best practices. As we have seen increased use of water in our operations, we have continued to invest in water conservation efforts through our global water sustainability program. How strategy is being implemented and financial implications: In late 2015 and early 2016, we established 2 global team of experts to increase our conservation efforts. This increased effort resulted in our highest water savings ever â€“ new projects implemented during 2016 are estimated to save 1.2 billion gallons water/year. Although our primary driver for water conservation efforts is to reduce our environmental impact, we also save money as a result. For example, during 2016 we invested $12.2 million in water (or energy & water) conservation projects, which are expected to saving $5.1 million/year.

From research to manufacturing, weâ€™re developing new products that are green by design and require fewer resources. Weâ€™re doing this by integrating green chemistry principles into product and process development, installing water efficiency projects and implementing behavioral changes to reduce their overall water consumption and improve water efficiency.  This strategy is being implemented to take advantage of the opportunity water presents and IFF has committed $1-2M annually for sustainability capital projects that include improve water efficiency. We are pleased to have achieved an overall year-over-year water use per ton of production reduction of approximately 31.5 percent due to the elimination of once-through cooling and several water-saving projects recently implemented at the facility level. Examples of these projects include improving cleaning processes as well as improving operational behaviors. In 2016, we surpassed our water use reduction goal by achieving a 58% reduction.We are pleased to have achieved an overall year-over-year water use per ton of production reduction of approximately 31.5 percent due to the elimination of once-through cooling and several water-saving projects recently implemented at the facility level.

Purchase of water to operate our facilities is part of Juniper OPEX. By successfully reducing water consumption it would drive cost savings. When retrofitting and building out new offices, Juniper considers opportunities to implement efficient water fixtures and reduce our dependency on potable water. Juniperâ€™s investments into water efficient fixtures in restrooms create water savings of 30% for the Sunnyvale headquarters. Additionally, by using native plants and recycled water for landscaping and other specific operations, Juniper is able to reduce our demand and spend on potable water.
Juniperâ€™s water efficiency and conservation practices contribute to our eligibility for the Bay Area Green Business certification, as well as the Sunnyvale campus buildingsâ€™ LEED Gold and Platinum certifications. Independent third-party certifications, like LEED, ISO 14001, and Bay Area Green Business, affirm our commitment to conservation and corporate citizenship to interested stakeholders, including customers, employees, investors and regulators. Juniperâ€™s customers, employees and investors currently assess companies on the basis of proactive environment and social responsibility stances and will continue to increase their focus on this as more regulations come into play and water management becomes a greater financial risk. Being certified by independent certification bodies contribute to our brand and helps Juniper stand out as an environmental leader.Additionally, Juniper has been recognized for environmental achievement in operations, in product innovation, and in resiliency - all as outcomes of the companyâ€™s dedication to reducing environmental impact.  For example, Juniper was ranked in the top 100 of Newsweek Top Green Companies in the U.S. for corporate sustainability and environmental impact.  The company was also recognized by the Global Supply Chain Resiliency Council for its use of technology to achieve customer-supplier collaboration and best practices in supply chain resiliency and risk management.

Kellogg has a company-wide goal to reduce global water use 15% (per tonne of food produced) and to implement water reuse projects in 25% of our plants by 2020 from a 2015 baseline. This goal encourages all facilities to reduce water usage which will improve water efficiency and deliver cost savings to the business. This is our second generation goal, set after achieving a 7% reduction in water use (per tonne of food produced) and an absolute water use reduction of 10% since 2005. These reductions represent cost savings for the company. During CAGNY in we shared total estimated cost savings of approximately $28 Million USD from manufacturing sustainability achievements 2008-2015, which includes cost savings from increased water efficiency. The following strategies are currently being implemented to meet these commitments and deliver cost savings to the business:-Site specific water efficiency targets for every global manufacturing site-Targeting strategic sites for water reuse projects based on risks and opportunities (including cost)-Lower return threshold for sustainability capital projects, including those that reduce water useImplementation of these strategies and others have resulted in a 2.7 percent water use reduction (per tonne of food produced), the implementation of water reuse products at 9 percent of our manufacturing facilities, and an estimated nearly $300,000 USD cost savings in 2016.

As part of our Go Green program, Lockheed Martin established a 30% water reduction goal by 2020 measured from a 2010 baseline. This program promotes smart water stewardship to improve operational efficiencies. Since 2010, a team of subject matter experts from facilities engineering and production and process engineering called the â€œTiger Teamâ€ have been conducting in-depth analyses of energy and water systems across the company to identify projects for implementation. In 2016, the Tiger Team conducted 12 structured improvement events resulting in energy and water savings through infrastructure and process/production optimizations. In 2016 alone, Lockheed Martin avoided approximately $26 million (compared to a 2010 baseline) in energy and water costs through the implementation of similar projects over the years.
In 2015, Lockheed Martin demonstrated our commitment to energy solutions by combining several commercial energy products and service businesses into a single organization. Lockheed Martin Energy now delivers a comprehensive portfolio including: our bioenergy technology that converts waste into clean fuel; tidal energy technology; energy storage solutions that improve electrical grid efficiency and enable increased use of renewables; and energy management solutions and performance contracts that enable our customers to reduce their energy and deliver cost avoidances. Some of the renewable energy offerings we have in-place or in development today include ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), wave and tidal power, and waste-to-energy generation. Many of these technologies utilize the existing power in the oceans to generate clean energy. These provide energy generation opportunities that are less water intensive than traditional energy generation processes such as fossil fuel generation.
Lockheed Martin was selected by NASA to design and build the U.S. geostationary operational environment satellite series, GOES-R, which will be used by NOAA for short-term weather forecasting, to estimate rainfall and snow accumulation, detect early identification of storm intensification and severe weather. In 2016, Lockheed Martin completed and launched the GOES-R weather satellite which will provide the U.S. National Weather Service with advanced severe weather prediction capabilities to save lives in storm-threatened areas and help meteorologists issue winter storm warnings and spring snow melt advisories.

Our current strategy sets a target of further reducing water use 20 percent per occupied room by 2020 over 2007 levels. As of YE 2016, we have reduced our global water consumption by 7.7% per occupied room.  We have accomplished this reduction through pursuit of a variety of actions designed to reduce water use at our hotel properties.
In pursuit of our water conservation goals, we have implemented a number of projects designed to enhance the efficient use of water at the hotels we manage. These include low-flow faucet and toilet fixtures, water sub-meters and more efficient laundry and dishwashing formulations.
Marriott recognizes the increasing interest among its customers in calculating the environmental impact of their room stays and events. Hotels which can demonstrate and communicate their sustainability may attract more business from customers focused on environmental issues.
New recruits in the hotel industry are more likely to cite environmental leadership as a factor in choosing employers.  Employee engagement is a key factor in driving the success of our business and environmental strategy.

Our factories rely on water as an ingredient and for our manufacturing processes, so reducing the costs and risks associated with secure water supplies is a business opportunity. In water-scarce areas, we can also maintain good relationships with local communities by ensuring our usage does not impact on their needs.We call our strategy for realizing these opportunities our Sustainable in a Generation (SiG) program. Based on the best-available scientific data, SiG aims to decouple the environmental impacts of our operations, including water impacts, from business growth. We will achieve this by making efficiency improvements and employing new technologies to make absolute reductions in our usage. Our focus is on locations where water is scarce and the associated risks and opportunities are greatest. Our target for our factories is to improve water efficiency in water-scarce areas by 15% by 2020 from a 2015 baseline.

Ninety-seven percent of the water used in our value chain is for growing crops. Our impact assessments have identified a number of water-intensive agricultural raw materials grown in areas of high baseline water stress, whose supply chains can be strengthened through better water management.In one example, we are working with basmati rice farmers in Pakistan to introduce alternate wetting anddrying, an irrigation technique that reduceswater and GHG emissions and improves yields, and is considered ground-breaking water management practice in the rice industry. Weâ€™re also taking part in a project led by the Swiss development organization, Helvetas, which aims to improve water efficiency and productivityfor rice growers in Asia. In Pakistan, we have already seen a 32% increase in farmer income and a 30% reduction in water use since the project began, and weâ€™re working to expand these practices to rice farmers outside our supply chain. Mars Food is a member of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP), an industry collaboration that has developed a global rice sustainability standard. In 2016, we ran a pilot project to investigate the climate change resilience and adaptive capacity of rice growers in Spain over the next 10-20 years, to inform our sourcing strategies.

Our impact assessments have identified a number of water-intensive agricultural raw materials grown in areas of high baseline water stress, whose supply chains can be strengthened through better water management.In one example, we are working with basmati rice farmers in Pakistan to introduce alternate wetting anddrying, an irrigation technique that reduceswater and GHG emissions and improves yields, and is considered ground-breaking water management practice in the rice industry. Weâ€™re also taking part in a project led by the Swiss development organization, Helvetas, which aims to improve water efficiency and productivityfor rice growers in Asia. In Pakistan, we have already seen a 32% increase in farmer income and a 30% reduction in water use since the project began, and weâ€™re working to expand these practices to rice farmers outside our supply chain. Mars Food is a member of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP), an industry collaboration that has developed a global rice sustainability standard. In 2016, we ran a pilot project to investigate the climate change resilience and adaptive capacity of rice growers in Spain over the next 10-20 years, to inform our sourcing strategies.

Microsoft can provide businesses and governments with technology and IT services to boost resiliency to local disruptions from flooding. With our georedundant datacenters, the likelihood of a significant weather-related disaster shutting down our services is very unlikely. Organizations in flood-affected areas can resume operations as soon as they are able to restore Internet access (or even continue operations without disruption from an alternative site with Internet access). We are investing to deliver cloud solutions across our product lines; two of our most significant services for businesses are Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure. Our global cloud service operations are supported by one of the largest physical networks in the world, with several industry certifications including ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and SAS70 Type II. We use georeplicated customer workloads (keeping multiple copies of workloads in multiple locations) to improve reliability. We have more than 2,000 people working on cloud infrastructure and more than 30,000 software engineers involved in cloud-based activities. For organizations that rely on on-premises software, high-availability features such as replication and mirroring in our software enable organizations to design and implement reliable and resilient mission-critical solutions. This opportunity could help us maintain or exceed growth levels for our business (which in FY16, the reporting period, represented $85.32 billion in annual revenue).
Microsoft is using technology to not only better understand and address our own water use but also help accelerate the worldâ€™s understanding and management of critical water-related resources. IT systems generally, and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios more specifically, can address a variety of mitigation strategies from reduction, recycling, and recovery of water resources to decision support tools used to evaluate the risks and solutions associated with water security. We are currently exploring opportunities for technology innovation built on the Microsoft Azure platform to help manage water issues. Our basic strategy consists of activating multisector partnerships to advance solutions to water challenges; developing new solutions that take advantage of cloud-based technologies to address water challenges; and enabling people and organizations to quantify and address water-related risks. For example, in FY16 (the reporting period) we partnered with Ecolab to develop the Water Risk Monetizer (WRM) tool to help businesses understand water-related risks and quantify risks in financial terms. We will begin by identifying and testing ideas like WRM within our own datacenters with the goal of sharing best practices and, where applicable, developing commercial offerings. Technology opportunities could ultimately help us maintain or exceed growth levels for our business (which, in FY16, the reporting period, represented $85.32 billion in annual revenue).

NVIDIAâ€™s GPU technology is being leveraged to enable advanced research into climate and water challenges.  For example, Orbital Insight developed an NVIDIA GPU-accelerated deep learning system that is measuring the surface levels of freshwater reserves across the globe based on images from the U.S. Geological Survey's Landsat 8 satellite. These images are fed into a neural network that searches for water, pixel by pixel, building a database of billions of pixels to train from. Thanks to this mapping work, community water managers and policymakers can make better decisions about water management based on a clearer picture of how much is available. NVIDIA has developed relationships with institutions using our GPU technology to advance climate change and water resources science and solutions. We provide support including consulting, code optimization and â€˜co-designâ€™ to help them optimize their use of our technology. We provide early access to hardware and software, and developer technical support. Our annual $150,000 Global Impact Award for work addressing important social and environmental problems awards a researcher or institution using our technology to achieve breakthrough results. While it is not possible to accurately quantify the financial implications of this opportunity, we estimate that associated impacts in any given quarter could be above $7 million in additional revenue, our threshold for determining substantiveness for the purposes of CDP reporting.

Lower costs for plant operations and less dependency on local or regional water sources by recirculating and recycling water and investing in water efficiency programs and equipment. By increasing the recycling/recirculating ratio at plants Owens Corning has reduced its fresh water purchases resulting in financial benefits. Additionally, water efficiency programs including leak detection, meter installation, and water mapping have increased water efficiency at many of our plants. Our long term strategy is to use lessons learned from our US plants and expand water recycling to all plants possible. Decreased water use not only decreases our intake costs, but also decreases costs associated with treating water to meet our quality standards and discharging costs. Using an appropriate average cost of water for our industry and global nature of our company- if we were to reduce our water use by 10% (from 2015 levels) our potential savings for water intake alone would be over $2 million. One of our plants has decreased their absolute municipal water use by over 38% over a 6 year period through leak detection and more efficient equipment, These measures resulted in an estimated intake savings of nearly $200,000 in 2016. This does not include any associated discharge or processing savings.

The aspirational aim of our Performance with Purpose water stewardship program is to improve water security for our supply chain and the communities in which we operate. Improved water security usually translates into improved economic opportunity for all. Our strategy to achieve our goals include delivery of several water-specific goals, including replenishing the water we consume back into high water risk watersheds as well as advocating for stronger water governance. For example, in Monterrey, Mexico, we have invested in the TNC Water Fund which uses market financial mechanisms to drive improved protection of source watersheds.  We have invested over $3 million in Water Funds in LATAM as well as watershed conservation projects in North America.
The initiatives in which we are engaged with our portfolio of NGO partners provide a transformative opportunity. Our collaboration with global partners is expected to result in greater water availability where it did not previously exist, thereby providing more sustainable access to water for the community, more sustainable solutions to the global water crisis, and more sustainable access to water for our manufacturing operations.  For example, the PepsiCo Foundation has partnered with several organizations to invest millions of dollars in providing access to safe water for over 11 million people in developing markets such as India.
Conserving water is good for our business and the environment wherever we operate. By the end of 2015, we had reduced our water use per unit of production by 25.8% since 2006 from our legacy operations, exceeding our target of a 20% reduction and delivering a cost saving of approximately $19 million in 2015 as compared to a 2006 run rate.
PepsiCo has an opportunity to improve the resiliency of our agricultural supply chain through better water management.  From 2010 to 2016, we worked with our U.K. farmers to achieve a 50 percent reduction in agricultural carbon emissions of key growers and a reduction of 50% in water use in water-stressed areas. Furthermore, farmer yields increased as their environmental impacts decreased.  We achieved this goal through investment in technology such as drip irrigation, and training farmers to use the i-cropTM water management tool and the GHG management Cool Farm Tool.
Our ability to achieve our goals is possible in part by collaborating with business, academic experts and NGOs. We are actively involved in the UN Global Compactâ€™s CEO Water Mandate, the WBCSD water leadership group, the International Finance Corporationâ€™s 2030 Water Resources Group and the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable. These forums allow us to learn from other companies and share our own experiences across a spectrum of industries, including food and beverage manufacturing, power generation and construction. This also enables us to discuss water-related issues and advance solutions on a pre-competitive basis.

We set water use reduction targets for all PMI manufacturing facilities to drive progress towards our goal to achieve a 20% reduction in water use by 2015  (per million cigarettes equivalent, from a 2010 baseline). In 2015, we beat that target, achieving a 24% reduction and now focusing on a minimum 1% year-year reduction in the short term, with additional focus on operations present in water scarce areas. Our improvements in water efficiency, conservation and recycling at PMI manufacturing facilities are driven by a water reduction target. Through the water reduction projects we saved 107 megaliters and approximately $155,000 in 2016. As an example, since 2010, our Quebec facility has decreased its water consumption by over 81% - by the end of 2016 it saved more than 450,000 m3 of water. The main project that led to this reduction was the implementation of closed loop cooling systems.Though these opportunities are not currently considered substantial in relation to PMIâ€™s operations, revenue or expenditure, opportunities are still sought out because meeting our targets and becoming more efficient are important to us.
Since the majority of our water risks are in our supply chain, we have been working with our farmers to promote sustainable water management practices. Since 2002, we have developed a Good Agricultural Practices program (GAP), and defined as a contractual requirement for doing business with PMI. GAP defines the principles and standards we expect to be met by all those who grow and supply tobacco for PMI. Our GAP Implementation Guide lays out extensive agricultural environmental practices and guidance covering sustainable water management and soil management/conservation.PMI supports and expects all of itsâ€™ suppliers to continuously improve in the implementation of GAP. Suppliers conduct annual self-assessments of their GAP implementation and are provided with a management tool and set of measurable standards against which they rate themselves. Further, the information resulting from the farm by farm monitoring is consolidated into Key Performance Indicators that are used to assess suppliersâ€™ improvement in GAP over time.GAP is also monitored by third parties to verify supplier self-assessments every 3 years. We support farmers in the implementation of practices to improve the productivity and the quality of their crops, reduce the impact on the environment, and achieve safe and fair working conditions. Over 3,500 field technicians support farmers with knowledge transfer, access to inputs, technology and financing, and monitor adherence to our standards.

Stemming from our industry expertise and long-time commitment to research and development, we are uniquely positioned to empower designers and developers to create new possibilities for our rapidly evolving world. Through smart infrastructure, weâ€™re reducing hazards, complications and costs associated with water and lighting by enabling cities to better maintain and manage city infrastructure and efficiencies. In 2016, we set a 2020 goal to have a comprehensive understanding of the sustainability impacts and opportunities arising from the application of our technology. According to Markets and Markets, the smart water management market is expected to grow from ~$7M in 2015 to ~$18M by 2020. To leverage this potential opportunity, we are committed to improving water infrastructure and distribution management. As an example, in FY16, we worked with the San Diego Padres to reduce overall utility and water consumption at their stadium, Petco Park, by 25% in the next five years using products and services offered by Qualcomm Intelligent Solutions,Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., and OSIsoft. Ballparks represent a difficult and unusual challenge for facilities managers because occupancy can change from a handful of employees to full capacity in a matter of hours. With smarter technology, these managers can monitor near realtime water usage and natural gas and electricity consumption from sensors located throughout the Park.
Qualcomm is committed to developing and deploying transformative technologies in support of a sustainable world. This includes demonstrating the positive role mobile technologies can play in water-related issues through the Qualcomm Wireless Reach initiative. Wireless Reach brings advanced wireless technologies to underserved communities globally, improving lives through programs that strengthen economic and social development. As an example, Qualcomm Wireless Reach has mobile fishing programs in India, Brazil, Colombia and Senegal.   The Fishing with Mobile Nets program uses advanced wireless technologies, digital content and a virtual community platform to promote the economic and social development of traditional fishermen, women and youth in vulnerable villages in Colombia.  The program provides participants with 3G or 4G LTE connected tablets and smartphones as well as customized applications and training to support mobile education, improved business practices and the development of new economic activities.   The overall goal is to reduce poverty by raising productivity and income in these underserved communities. The program has been so successful that the Ministry of Information Communications Technology has made a commitment to replicate this program in additional communities across Colombia.

WATER SCARCITY APPROACHIn our facilities, our key management method includes SBD global Water Scarcity Plan which is based on 2013 launch of our global water scarcity strategy. This in-process management method includes mapping current SBD locations against the United Nations Environment Program's vital water graphic (2nd ed., 2008), performing an annual risk evaluation to prioritize our top 10 water consuming sites, and instituting water conservation efforts, governmental projects, and options for alternative water sources at high risk sites. This management method is also used to assess the level of risk potential during acquisitioned transaction considerations & due diligence.Example of a project implemented to manage water risk is the installation of a high-efficiency plating line at our Taiwan location which replaced 2 electroplating lines with a single high efficiency line equipped with a state of the art chrome recycling system resulting in an annual reduction of over 13 million gallons in cooling water discharge designed to offset and lower the highest risk score determined from our Water Scarcity Plan management method.The annual risk evaluation, prioritizing the top 10 water consuming sites, and finding options for alternative water sources would reduce the magnitude of water scarcity impact for SBD to "low" and is expected to push out timeframe of the risk impact to beyond 10 years.

As part of our water reduction targets, we require all our facilities to upload water reduction project detail into our their projects in the our EHS web platform. 79 projects were added for tracking in 2016 tracking system (in addition to the ones started in previous years), including harvesting rain water for gardening & toilet flushing, installation of water saving taps (e.g. spray) & waterless urinals. This management method is expected to decrease operational costs. The 79 projects added in 2016, are expected to decrease operational costs by 30k$/year, with an investment of 171k$. Every year, starting in 2016, our Corporate is also funding ECOSMART sustainability projects with long term return of investment, that would not be approved under a standard financial approach. Focus is now being given to alternative energy (solar, wind), though all media.

WATER SCARCITY APPROACHIn our facilities, our key management method includes SBD global Water Scarcity Plan which is based on 2013 launch of our global water scarcity strategy. This in-process management method includes mapping current SBD locations against the United Nations Environment Program's vital water graphic (2nd ed., 2008), performing an annual risk evaluation to prioritize our top 10 water consuming sites, and instituting water conservation efforts, governmental projects, and options for alternative water sources at high risk sites. This management method is also used to assess the level of risk potential during acquisitioned transaction considerations & due diligence.Example of a project implemented to manage water risk is the installation of a high-efficiency plating line at our Taiwan location which replaced 2 electroplating lines with a single high efficiency line equipped with a state of the art chrome recycling system resulting in an annual reduction of over 13 million gallons in cooling water discharge designed to offset and lower the highest risk score determined from our Water Scarcity Plan management method.The annual risk evaluation, prioritizing the top 10 water consuming sites, and finding options for alternative water sources would reduce the magnitude of water scarcity impact for SBD to "low" and is expected to push out timeframe of the risk impact to beyond 10 years.

Consumers & Sysco customers are demanding more local and sustainably-sourced products. Recognition as the industry leader in sustainability is a brand enhancement, but we believe we also have an opportunity to further enhance customer loyalty and potentially gain new customers by enhancing our operational efficiency and increasing our offerings of local and sustainable products, including products that conserve water or enhance water quality.Our vision is to be our customersâ€™ most valued and trusted business partner. Advancing our sustainability initiatives enhances our customer relationships either by elevating their trust in Sysco as an environmentally and socially responsible business, or by enabling us to provide more sustainable products to help them reach their business goals. To that end, we recently established a full time Corporate Social Responsibility function to strategically identify and manage these efforts (specific pay and benefits are proprietary).Financial implications depend on the volume of increased business related to our customersâ€™ desire for sustainably-sourced products. Toward this end, we work with small and midsized specialty producers to provide customers with locally-produced items. Our FreshPoint locations have implemented technology that enables tracking of local purchases from farm to customer, and our Broadline companies have various local food programs. May-Dec 2016 sales from FreshPoint produce locations have totalled over $1.1 billion.

Some of our technology solutions may enable water efficiency and conservation â€“ in utilities distribution and monitoring or home appliances, for example. However, we have not yet quantified this information.
In 2016, we continued to fund capital-improvement projects to further reduce, recycle and reuse water, especially in newly owned facilities. We plan to use our water champions to strategically focus and further increase our water-efficiency efforts. We also plan to do a feasibility study of at least one large, high-impact water-saving project. We will continue efforts to use water efficiently and reduce total water use.
Due to emerging technologies and lowered costs, we implemented a project to reuse industrial wastewater at one of our Texas facilities. This project has the ability to save a considerable amount of water (likely 60-80% recovery rate) at one facility. Once this pilot is complete, this focus will shift to the other TI Fabs, which could lead to significant reductions in water consumption over the next decade.

Tyson Foods has a goal to reduce water usage in its direct U.S.-based operations by 12% by 2020, compared to a 2015 baseline. This goal encourages all facilities to reduce water usage which will improve water efficiency and deliver cost savings to the business. The goal also includes the installation of new measuring and continuous monitoring equipment at the companyâ€™s U.S. plant locations that enable personnel to better manage water use in real-time. This proactive approach to water management could result in cost savings and improved water efficiency as well as strengthen our reputation with internal and external stakeholders.
In FY16, we launched an initiative to better understand sustainability related risks and opportunities within our business with the intent of establishing strategies and programs to strengthen our social and environmental performance, including performance related to water management. As part of this initiative as well as our deeper commitment to sustainable food production, we announced in May 2017 a collaboration with the World Resources Institute (WRI) to become an industry leader by setting outcome-based water conservation targets for our operations and our supply chain. We anticipate announcing the results of this collaboration in 2018.

We continue our conservation efforts with the Nature Conservancyâ€™s Arkansas Chapter. Over the last two years, including FY16, we have granted and provided volunteer support to help the chapter complete a significant stream bank restoration in the Oxbow section of the Kings River, monitor sediment reduction, and survey a tributary and plan its restoration. The support also includes projects on the Elk River and enrolling conservation easements in Arkansasâ€™ Buffalo National River watershed. Tyson employees have also been actively engaged in this partnership by supporting various on-the-ground conservation projects such as tree plantings, stream clean-ups, and water awareness learning centers.
While our compliance with water quality regulations isnâ€™t voluntary, as regulatory agencies continue to increase their focus on nutrient discharges we encounter more stringent limits via our wastewater discharge permits. Subsequently, we continue to apply technologies, strategies and processes to reduce nutrient levels in our surface water discharges. This creates cleaner water, and lessens pressure on existing water supply quality. In turn, this has potential to benefit our company by lowering our water supply risk.

We continue our conservation efforts with the Nature Conservancyâ€™s Arkansas Chapter. Over the last two years, including FY16, we have granted and provided volunteer support to help the chapter complete a significant stream bank restoration in the Oxbow section of the Kings River, monitor sediment reduction, and survey a tributary and plan its restoration. The support also includes projects on the Elk River and enrolling conservation easements in Arkansasâ€™ Buffalo National River watershed. Tyson employees have also been actively engaged in this partnership by supporting various on-the-ground conservation projects such as tree plantings, stream clean-ups, and water awareness learning centers.
While our compliance with water quality regulations isnâ€™t voluntary, as regulatory agencies continue to increase their focus on nutrient discharges we encounter more stringent limits via our wastewater discharge permits. Subsequently, we continue to apply technologies, strategies and processes to reduce nutrient levels in our surface water discharges. This creates cleaner water, and lessens pressure on existing water supply quality. In turn, this has potential to benefit our company by lowering our water supply risk.
Several of our products in our Building Efficiency business unit have the opportunity to help customers reduce their water use.  For example, Performance Contracting for Energy and Water Efficiency is one service offering that helps customers save water. Johnson Controls has been involved in energy-saving, performance-based contracting with public and private organizations since the inception of performance contracting in 1983. Since 2000, Johnson Controls has implemented more than 1,000 performance contracts with total guaranteed savings of more than $5.4 billion in North America alone. These projects have significantly reduced both water consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for hundreds of customers.
Several of our products in our Building Efficiency business unit have the opportunity to help customers reduce their water use.  We provide Automated Meter Reading (AMR) technology, accurate meter sizing and typing, leak detection and other water loss control measures. These methods can lower operational costs and allow customers to reallocate resources.
We help customers reduce energy and water consumption through conservation and operational changes.
In addition to working on water efficiency in our own facilities, we are also helping our customers save water. For example, our customer Stanford University in California cut its water use by 15 percent and is projected to save $420 million in operational costs thanks to a new central energy facility (CEF) developed with help from Johnson Controls. The new plant helps Stanford make substantial progress to meet California's statewide goal to reduce water use by 25 percent.

Our corporate campus in Glendale, Wisconsin provides a showcase for our water related efforts and represents the largest concentration of LEED Platinum buildings. Many have visited our campus, which provides many opportunities by being a showplace of excellent work environments, energy and water efficiency, and facility management initiatives.   In addition, the Johnson Controlsâ€™ new headquarters building in Shanghai has received the first-ever EDGE design-phase certification for an office building in China. EDGE, which stands for â€œExcellence in Design for Greater Efficiency,â€ is a green building certification system from IFC-World Bank Group. The facility is projected to save 44 percent energy, 42 percent water savings, and 21 percent embodied energy in materials savings. The minimum requirement for EDGE certification is to achieve no less than 20 percent total savings in energy, water and embodied energy in materials in each category compared to the local market standard.
Continue to seek water savings at all facilities globally.

In 2012 Union Pacific created a position dedicated to conservation of utilities net-work-wide. The financial savings can total in the millions year over year. The "Project Manager of Utility Management" manages a Utility Software Application that captures withdrawal data from more than 1,100 active municipal water accounts. The data helps locate trends, which can lead to the identification of underground leaks, conservation project opportunities and aids in increasing engagement.  In addition, the Project Manager leads â€œUtility Conservation Huntsâ€ throughout the year at the facility level.  During a routine data check, a major leak was suspected at our Livonia yard, in Maringouin, Louisiana.  We had the local water service foreman go out and investigate for leaks, of which several were found.  After the leak was fixed, total 2016 water withdrawal at this facility was reduced more than 50% in the following months.

Union Pacific-owned water rights allow for cost savings through avoidance of payments to local utilities and required installation of costly water infrastructure.
Union Pacific manages potential severe weather events through a combination of its experience in responding to weather events and long-range planning to maintain infrastructure, aggressive updating of equipment and a diverse portfolio of business. UP managed change in precipitation extremes and drought by employing the use of its available surge resources, adjusted transportation plans to use alternate switching yards, and gateways and repositioned resources to where they were most needed to increase velocity.
In some locations, Union Pacific maintains water wells to nourish vegetation that serves as a wind break for operations. Wind breaks reduce locomotive fuel consumption and resulting emissions and reduce maintenance required to clear the track and switches from blowing sand.

UTC sees water as an opportunity for our own operations as well as our suppliers. For our manufacturing sites, we mandate an annual reduction in water use of 5%, along with the implementation of up to 10 water best management practices. These actions increase our own water efficiency (as measured in a gallon/$ revenue basis), lower our costs of obtaining and handling water, and reduces our environmental regulatory liability by reducing our regulated water footprint. UTC's supply management organization is charged with ensuring the resilience and competitive advantage provided by UTC suppliers. Our 2020 supplier sustainability goal requires key suppliers to adopt 11 sustainability related practices, including annual improvements in either water efficiency or reductions in total water used. In addition to a reduction in potential supplier business disruption, UTC believes that better water management can result in suppliers becoming more sensitized to the subject of water as a business risk, which in turn will lead to greater levels of water use reduction on their part along with pushing out similar requirements to their own (UTC Tier II) suppliers.

In 2014, WhiteWave Foods commissioned a comparative cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Analysis and Water Footprint study of the environmental impacts associated with the production of Silk Soy, Almond, and Coconut beverages vs. Dairy beverages. The study accounts for emissions and water used in the entire supply chain, from agriculture to product use and disposal, and has been peer reviewed. The study found that, over the product lifecycle, plant based beverages use on average 900 fewer gallons of water per half gallon of finished product than its comparable dairy beverage products. We believe that our plant-based product portfolio, which currently accounts for more than 38% of our sales, appeals to customers who care about water conservation and helps to insulate our company against the negative impacts of climate change and drought. We will continue to invest in and grow our plant-based product portfolio.
Due to our Great Lakes basin and Mississippi River basin locations, many of our generating stations utilize open-cycle cooling. All of the water used for open-cycle cooling is returned to the water body. Among options for power plant cooling, our open-cycle systems are the most efficient technology choice. Therefore, this form of cooling maximizes plant efficiency and affords lower carbon emissions per unit of electrical generation compared to any other cooling technology options.

We recognize that water efficiency initiatives may also result in financial savings. For example eliminating once through cooling systems in air compressors at Webster is estimated to have saved the company ~$136,000 per year in water costs and water efficiency projects implemented at Webster between 2010 and 2014 is estimated to have saved the company ~$156,000 per year in water costs. Assuming a 10% saving in water use and sewer discharge costs in the US and Canada, would save ~$0.2M based on Xeroxâ€™s current water utility spend in these countries. To manage this opportunity for cost saving we have an ongoing water reduction program and monitor water withdrawal across the worldwide manufacturing, distribution and R&D facilities of our Technology business against our voluntary water reduction target. We set a corporate target to reduce absolute water withdrawals by 21% by 2014 against a 2009 baseline. In 2012, we achieved this goal early by reducing withdrawals by 35%. In 2013 and 2014 we sustained this achievement. We have now set a new corporate target to reduce absolute water withdrawals by 35% by 2020 against a 2010 baseline. We have a number of projects planned for 2016 and beyond to continue to reduce our water use and achieve this target.
In 2016 Xeroxâ€™s Managed Document Services offering (which includes our workflow automation services portfolio and cloud based products) represented 33% of our total 2016 revenue ($3,505 Million).Therefore assuming a 0.5% increase in our Managed Document Services offering equates to a ~$17.5Million increase in revenue.Xerox has a rich heritage of innovation, and innovation continues to be a core strength of the company as well as a competitive differentiator. Our aim is to create value for our customers, our shareholders and our people by driving innovation in key areasOur investments in innovation align with our growth opportunities in areas such:- Simplifying, automating and enabling business processes on the cloud via flexible platforms that run on robust and scalable infrastructure to enable greater business process agility and resilience; and- Reducing the environmental impact of digital printing including cloud based printing.Our innovation goals are supported by cross disciplinary research programs in our different research centers.  For example in 2016 in document outsourcing, we brought 35 workflow automation solutions to market and in 2017 we plan to extend our overall market leadership with the largest product launch in Xerox history. Our fleet of new multifunction devices, will help our customers transform how they work with leading security, high-performance apps, on-the-go print capabilities and cloud connectivity.
The increasing environmental awareness of consumers globally, particularly regarding climate change and water issues presents an opportunity for Xerox to inform the community about its environmental performance related to its water and other environmental goals through our outreach program. Xerox engages with the community on important matters that affect them in the following ways:â€¢ Our Annual Report on Global Citizenship provides EHS&S performance data on its products, processes and facilities along with information about its environmental sustainability challenges and goals.â€¢ External websites such as www.xerox.com and www.xerox.com/environment, provide current information on the EHS&S policies at Xerox, environmental attributes and performance of products and services, environmental goals and policies.â€¢ Through social media, blogs, presentations, panel discussions, media appearances, interviews and press releases.â€¢ Maintaining a working relationship with local town and village environmental authorities by routinely reporting data on process discharges to the town and village sewage treatment plant. â€¢ Xerox Campus at Webster, NY is participating in the New York Environmental Leaders (NYEL) program. It established a three-year commitment to reduce water consumption around the Webster campus. By the second year, we have been able to reduce water consumption by 25.7% from a 2014 baseline.

One of our major corporate business strategies is referred to as â€œsteel for fuel.â€  Under this strategy, we are investing in economic wind projects where the cost to build the facilities is offset by future fuel savings. The savings are currently significant because of low wind prices and available tax credits. Increasing our use of renewables has helped us manage our carbon footprint, but simultaneously has also helped us decrease our water footprint and risk. We recently announced plans for the largest multi-state wind investment in the country, adding over 3GW of wind that will save customers billions in future fuel costs. This investment will enable the long-term financial growth of our company and contributes to our strategic advantage.  Our successful implementation of these wind projects ensures our customers continue to receive reliable, low-cost energy and increased access to renewable energy resources.

Increasing our use of renewables has helped us manage our carbon footprint, but simultaneously has also helped us decrease our water footprint and risk. We recently announced plans for the largest multi-state wind investment in the country, adding over 3GW of wind that will save customers billions in future fuel costs. This investment will enable the long-term financial growth of our company and contributes to our strategic advantage.  Our successful implementation of these wind projects ensures our customers continue to receive reliable, low-cost energy and increased access to renewable energy resources.

Water conservation plans and programs help companies to specify procurement of more efficient building products and services, in addition to fostering innovation, partnership and behavioral changes.
Many organizations and investors are tracking sustainability programs and linking them to companies and the brands that they manage.  Green building labeling such as Green Key, Green Globe, LEEDÂ® and other recognized certification programs also help guests, investors and other stakeholders know that Wyndhamâ€™s owned, managed and leased properties meets certain environmental standards related to water withdrawals. Further over 17,000 Bloomberg analysts now track environmental, social and governance metrics as well as Socially Responsible Investment funds totaling over $45 trillion.  The Arabesque Partners and University of Oxford 2015 study,"From the Stockholder to Stakeholder", states that 88% of reviewed sources find that companies with robust sustainable practices  have better operating performance and 80% of the sources show that stock price is positively influenced by sustainable practices.
Where appropriate and possible, Yahoo uses existing hydropower for electricity to power its data centers. Existing hydropower affords us low-carbon electricity that is also low cost and less vulnerable to the price fluctuations that can result from changes to the cost of fossil fuel for regions that are more dependent upon coal or natural gas. We currently use hydropower in our owned and operated data centers in Quincy, Washington and Lockport, New York to take advantage of this opportunity.
YCC (Yahoo Compute Coop) design for low-water cooling of data centers is a strategy we are using to realize lower water use. Our Yahoo Compute Coop air-cooled data center design uses over 90 percent less water than conventional water- cooled data center design.  Our WUE in our Lockport, New York data center is ,031.  For roughly 200 hours out of the year during hot and humid conditions, we use a direct evaporative cooling system. Typically the system generates no or minimal wastewater, resulting in savings from both avoided cost of water and avoided cost of wastewater disposal. We estimate the resulting savings to be less than $150K per year at our Lockport facility. Should costs of water and wastewater increase in the future or prove more expensive in other locations, savings will likely increase.

Under Blueline â€“ Yum! Brandsâ€™ proprietary green building standards â€“ new stores realize cost savings associated with water conservation. The Global Sustainability team currently works with the brandsâ€™ development teams to implement the standards and verify them through an easy-to-use online tool. This drives progress toward our goal to have 100% of new Company-owned restaurants designed and built to Blueline standards. Franchisees also voluntarily participate in the program.  The technologies and approaches used in Blueline are based on test projects whereby we sub-metered consumption to help best determine appropriate strategies to implement.
Yum! Brands stores are able to improve their water efficiency by updating water fixtures in their kitchen, drink station, bathroom and irrigation systems. To make sure these fixtures are utilized and updated, when appropriate, we occasionally sub-meter Buildingsâ€™ water usage to realize opportunities and incorporate water efficiency into Yum! Brandsâ€™ green building standards. Since 2005, our water efficiency projects have saved over 4,700 megaliters of water across the globe.
There is opportunity for us to build positivecommunity relations by being a goodenvironmental steward, which includes our focus on water conservation. Thatâ€™s why we continually evaluate the impact water has on our business and the communities we serve through tools like WRI Aqueduct and materiality assessments.
SRI investors consider water risks andopportunities in their evaluation of ourpublic securities through their considerationof ESG research from MSCI, Sustainalytics, Bloomberg, CDP, Ceres, and other sources. We therefore pursue water efficiency efforts that generate apositive return on investment and disclose them as part of our targeted communications with SRI investors throughthe mediums mentioned above.
Recognize water as an important opportunity, engage early and broadly, operate responsibly. This opportunity will Increase our potential to gain a license, community's approval or accelerate the permitting process.  This may reduce project costs and timelines by identifying more collaborative approaches and by engaging proactively with communities of interest.  For example, Teck is engaging with numerous Communities of Interest (COIs) as part of our efforts to address water quality constituents released by mining activities throughout the Elk River watershed, where five of our steelmaking coal operations are located.
Identify and assess opportunities to generate power and create revenue and renewable energy.
Identify and implement projects to improve water use efficiency.  Water use efficiency can be improved through enhanced water recycling and reuse. In 2016, we continued to work towards improving our water use efficiency at our operations.  For example, we have conducted trials to minimize the volume of water required for dust control.  By adding a surfactant to the water used for dust control on our haul roads, our trials have demonstrated that we can reduce the volume of water needed by half, which also creates cost savings in labour and energy (fuel) consumption for our water trucks. We estimate that we can cut costs associated with dust control at an operation by almost half, which typically are on the order of millions of dollars per year.  The results of the trials are being analysed and we are expecting to use the results for developing guidance on best practices.

Water presents opportunity for competitive advantage for Tessy Plastics (TP) due to its geographic location in Central New York (CNY) sitting miles away from Lake Ontario & its rich river basin. This water source is not considered at risk for the foreseeable future. An ample water supply is critical for injection molding by TP & low risk in the Great Lakes Region ensures stable & low market prices for water, which is a competitive advantage for TP. To take advantage of stability of the Great Lakes, as TP looks to expand operations, the companyâ€™s strategy of staying in CNY gives it a firm competitive advantage. As an example of this strategy in action, in the reporting year, despite pressure from a customer to relocate a section of our business to South Carolina, TP elected to invest over $32M for the 240,000 sqft expansion of our Syracuse plant. The opportunity in water risk is that our locations in CNY are at a lower risk for overall water risk & physical risk to quality than the area in South Carolina based on the assessment tool WRI Aqueduct. This expansion allows TP to increase production and expand customer base, with an estimated sales growth of 5-8%. In addition to the anticipated increase in sales, TP would realize this opportunity of competitive advantage because local building expansion allows them to market efficient and reduced risk to operations, as well as reduce its impact on the environment.
Pinnacle continues to look for opportunities to reduce total water usage as well as reuse of water after processing which will directly result in overall cost savings.  We've established 2020 goals to reduce our overall water consumption rate by 40% versus 2012 and through 2016, have achieved a reduction of 35% through a combination of investments in new equipment and continuous improvement programs at our manufacturing plants. For example, through a combination of improved throughputs, efficiency projects and capital investments, we have saved over 100 million gallons of water annually at our Fort Madison, IA plant.

As discussed later in Question 9.1a, water usage at Hanesbrands textile facilities is directly linked to energy usage, as some water must be heated as part of the bleaching and dyeing processes. Reducing water volume required for these processes also reduces fuel requirements and has a positive impact on carbon emissions. Through process improvements and innovation, Hanesbrands has reduced water usage. In some facilities, this reduces the fees paid to the government or to a third-party supplier. At five of its major textile facilities, Hanesbrands operates its own water treatment and wastewater treatment plants on site. Volume reductions also impact the costs associated with water treatment. Hanesbrands has communicated its achievements in energy, water, and carbon management through its "Hanes for Good" website, and has noted its US ENERGY STAR awards in its catalogs and social media. Hanesbrands has been recognized for its environmental stewardship (to include water resource management at both the corporate level and at the facility and country level. Hanesbrands continues to search for alternative technologies and process innovations to conserve water and to investigate options for recycling additional water within the manufacturing process.

DGC conducts research on the potential of acid rock drainage (ARD)  which if not prevented can have a very large costs for operations and for closure. This is a global risk for all types of mines and all commodities. DGC is a low sulfur site and hence a low risk ARD site. However more information is needed to confirm and validate predictions for the operations period and for closure period. By conducting this work the risks of problems developing can be reduced. This can reduce the closure bonding held as a financial assurance with the regulatory agencies. It can also give aboriginal groups and the public greater certainty that end land use closure objectives can be achieved.  This work also anticipates more demanding regulations evolving in the future for water management and for closure. Although not totally preemptive these programs can significantly reduce the potential financial and reputational impact on the company.

Regeneron is actively installing low flow water fixtures in existing facilities, and experimenting with rainwater collection systems in several locations. By lowering our water spending, we are potentially decreasing our cost of goods sold and reducing any risks to future water price increases. We anticipate savings of less than $1,000,000 on this opportunity.
In order to identify areas with the greatest opportunity to increase our water efficiency, Regeneron has invested in equipment to sub-meter our water consumption at all of our locations, with the goal of company-wide sub-metering by 2018.
All new and renovated buildings at Regeneron have low flow plumbing fixtures, which have dramatically cut our water consumption per employee.
In 2016, Regeneron decentralized all of its steam generation at its headquarters in Tarrytown, New York.  This helped reduce our water consumption by eliminating system deficiencies that contributed to water loss.

Through annual engineering & EHS project collaboration, AbbVie maximizes its opportunities for water conservation and to ensure its continued availability and quality. Specific examples include water purification technology upgrades, re-circulation valve installation & metering projects to facilitate better accounting. AbbVie's strategy is to identify and implement at least five projects annually that positively influence our commitment to reduce our global carbon footprint. Management is held accountable for these projects and annual performance appraisal assesses the degree to which these projects were executed. Opportunity projects are endorsed by either a financial return justification (achieving a defined hurdle-rate over the life of the project), or by a dedicated "non-financially justified" corporate EHS fund (comprised annually of hundreds of thousands of capital and expense dollars). Sites worldwide submit detailed project applications to solicit financial support from the EHS Fund for their opportunity projects.Also - AbbVie's Supplier Code of Conduct brochure (attached) is a tool used to communicate expectations with respect to supplier resilience and responsible environmental management.

To realize the opportunity for improved water efficiency, our water conservation strategy is focused on the following initiatives:  smart metering/leak detection, employee engagement, landscaping/irrigation improvements, expansion of non-freshwater sources, and efficient water infrastructure.  Examples of project implemented in 2016 to support the strategy include: (1) Smart  meters â€“ Four HP sites located in Spain, Romania, Italy and Bulgaria installed nearly 100  smart meters which alert staff to potential water leaks and suspicious water flows. Fixing these leaks has reduced water use by 20-25% on average. In 2017, we will expand use of this technology to other sites globally. (2) Improved irrigation and landscaping - Two HP sites in the United States, Palo Alto and Boise, responded to local drought conditions by changing landscape and irrigation practices. We replaced non-indigenous turf grass with native species and converted to drip-irrigation, reducing water use and costs. The Boise project will save 82,900 cubic meters of water annually.  (3) Water infrastructure upgrades - In Singapore, we implemented innovative process updates to the deionized water system in Singapore to reduce the amount of rejected water. These enhancements will save the equivalent of 87,443 cubic meters of water annually. This yielded a cost savings to our operations of over  $110,000 US Dollars savings annually.
Our strategy to realize cost savings has been to pursue projects with an ROI of 3.5 years or less.  A few examples include: (1) leak detection projects in in Spain, Romania, Italy and Bulgaria are averaging an ROI of 2 years or better. (2) Infrastructure improvements to the water delivery system in Guadalajara in 2015 achieved an ROI less than 1 year.  (3) The sustainable landscaping project in Boise, Idaho will pay for itself quickly in 1.6 years in reduced operating costs

Our water conservation strategy is focused on the following initiatives:  smart metering/leak detection, landscaping/irrigation improvements, expansion of non-freshwater sources, and efficient water infrastructure.  Examples of progress made in 2016 include: (1) Smart meters.  Automated metering improvements were implemented in the UK (e.g. Nottingham) to increase the frequency of data reporting to provide a more accurate overview of water use, potentially unlocking thousands of dollars of savings.  Additional metering was installed in our Shanghai campus to track water reuse quantities to increase water efficiency and monitoring as part of HPEâ€™s building control strategy.-. (2) Twenty-six million liters of water, equivalent to 10.4 Olympic swimming pools, was saved through two rainwater capture projects at 2 HPE offices in the water-stressed region of Bangalore, India with a cost savings of 20k USD per year.

Our operations overlay the Marcellus and Utica shale plays, where natural gas exploration & production activity levels have increased in recent years.  Natural gas production uses large volumes of water to hydraulically fracture horizontal shale gas wells.  We believe these two activities can be mutually combined to the benefit of the company, to gas producers in the region, and to the environment.  This can occur by utilizing treated mine water in combination with freshwater and flowback water used in gas operations to reduce freshwater needs for gas production.

Our innovative technology known as residue filtration represents a potential marketing opportunity and revenue stream through third party sales. With this technology, bauxite residue generated from the alumina refining process is forced through very large filters that squeeze out the water, which is recycled in the refining process.  Because of the technology, the refinery will not need to construct a new residue storage area for at least 20 years compared to every five years previously. This technology can be marketed to other alumina producers.We are also focused on the use of significantly lower-cost natural-system applications for both water reduction and treatment. Such applications, which could cost up to 75% less than conventional technologies, include green roofs, water irrigation onto fields of grass and trees, engineered wetlands, and the use of various media for filtration of water contaminants, known as natural media filtration.

Anadarko is currently assessing and designing technologies and opportunities to continue to enhance such systems. For example, in four onshore operating areas, Anadarko has constructed and continues to enhance water recycling and delivery systems.
Anadarko is currently installing and operating equipment and systems to increase water recycling and anticipates it will continue to do so into the future. For example, in West Texas a water recycling system has resulted in the reuse of more than 1 million barrels of produced water. In Pennsylvania, when we are completing wells we aim to reuse 100% of flowback water recovered from our operations.
As cited by Energy In Depth on its website, the combustion of 1 Bcf of natural gas as a source of fuel creates more than 11 million gallons, or nearly 42 megaliters of water as vapor, a volume which is not typically accounted for in the measurement of life cycle water management for the oil and gas industry. Anadarko is working with industry to develop a valid approach to evaluating this aspect of the use of natural gas.

"AT&T products and services can also help others manage their water use. Our company provides connectivity for monitoring systems so that users can monitor their water use remotely and in real time.Some examples include:â€¢	We work with HydroPoint, a provider of smart water management solutions, to help customers remotely monitor and manage their irrigation systems. This collaboration ultimately saves 15 billion gallons of water in a single year. Click here to watch a video about AT&T and Hydropoint.â€¢	AT&T teamed up with Mueller Water Co. and IBM in the National Institute of Standards and Technologyâ€™s (NIST) Global Smart Cities Challenge to demonstrate how cellular-based technology can eliminate unnecessary water loss. Our team places sensors in water distribution infrastructure to collect data about pressure, temperature and leak detection. That data is then wirelessly transmitted to a smart dashboard that is monitored by a utility. These technologies ensure security for our water distribution infrastructure while reducing unnecessary waste of this critical resource.â€¢	In 2012, we engaged the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) to develop a set of tools and goals around cooling-related water efficiency. The result of our work was a Water Management Application, or WaterMAPP, a toolkit of resources that can be used to manage water and identify opportunities for increased efficiency."

The need to mobilize additional adaptation finance is particularly pressing in developing countries where adaptation capacity is often the lowest while needs are high.  Through partnerships such as the Global Innovation Lab, we are participating in efforts to pilot new forms of innovative climate finance solutions which will be needed to broaden investment opportunities both generally, and for our company specifically, in climate mitigation and adaptation in these important economic growth regions.We are also active as one of 20 principals in the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance. The Lab identifies, develops, and pilots transformative climate finance instruments and aims to drive billions of dollars of private investment into climate change mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. As a principal, we review submissions to the Lab, discuss the merits of each proposal, help improve the structure to make each idea more investable, and participate in working groups to help bring the finalist instruments to market.
Our research has found that investors, and particularly millennial investors, are increasingly focused on ESG factors when making investment decisions. This creates opportunities for our Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM) business. As of December 31, 2016, GWIM clients had more than $11.3 billion in assets with a clearly defined ESG approach. Across the industry, there has been a 33 percent increase in assets under management in ESG-type funds in just the last two years. And as millennialsâ€™ wealth grows, there could be an inflow of $15â€“20 trillion into ESG investments over the next 20 to 30 years. Investors increasingly understand that taking ESG performance into account isnâ€™t just the right thing to do, it also makes good business sense. A 2016 Equity Strategy Focus Point report from our Global Research team, titled â€œESG: good companies can make good stocks,â€ found that a companyâ€™s ESG performance could be an indicator of its future stock performance.

From 2012-2016, Baxter worked with an external partner to develop a rainwater collection and grey water treatment system, as well as a sanitation educational program in San Juan Tlacotenco, a community of about 2,000 people. Baxter targeted this community because it is located near Baxter's site in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where the watershed is vulnerable. As a result of the project and nearly $85,000 in funding, the community now has a guaranteed water supply during the rainy season and students receive training on healthier behaviors and the importance of water.

Increased cost for water as a result of constrained availability makes capital investments in water conservation methods (or projects with a longer ROI) more feasible and save more money over the lifetime of the project.   With support from management we are making changes to investment guidelines related to sustainability related projects. This will accelerate investment in projects which reduce energy consumption and water.

A key focus within our manufacturing operation is to increase plant productivity while decreasing our environmental footprint â€“ which we believe will provide major benefits in our continuing efforts to reduce the energy, carbon, water, and waste impacts of producing our therapies. By successfully applying three-fold productivity improvements to two key candidates in the companyâ€™s mid-stage pipeline, we have been able to produce more drug substance without increasing the companyâ€™s water and energy consumption. We are exploring new approaches that have the potential to significantly decrease the water and energy resources needed to manufacture a dose of medicine. A third initiative linked to this goal is to decrease or eliminate the use of solvents in the manufacturing of a new class of drug compounds.The centerpiece of this strategy is underway in Solothurn, Switzerland, where we are building a next-generation, largescale biologics manufacturing facility. This facility will be one of the most advanced of its kind. When the facility is operational, we hope to produce 10 metric tons of antibodies per year, making it three times more productive than our other facilities currently in use.

Biogen consumes a substantial amount of potable water each year for heat rejection, largely through evaporative losses at cooling towers. The major Biogen sites can eliminate evaporative potable water consumption associated with cooling towers by implementing the following technologies: Adiabatic Coolers and Hybrid Cooling Towers (RTP), Ground Water System (HillerÃ¸d), Dry-Coolers (Cambridge).

Through a screening life cycle assessment to map and quantify the environmental impacts of the next-generation manufacturing process compared to traditional approaches, we focused on the acquisition of material inputs, like water and energy, through the production of the drug substance that goes into our final products. The results of the assessment are very promising, indicating that the next generation manufacturing process is significantly less energy intensive per kilogram of output and is more water efficient. Based on the projections of water demand for the new process compared to the current process, the assessment indicated that the next generation process may be expected to use 44 percent less water per batch and 89 percent less water per kilogram of output.

Under the ISO 50001 certification process, Biogen's HillerÃ¸d facility has identified a number of water efficiency projects to implement. One example is an opportunity associated with the use of water in the manufacturing process, which is projected to be reduced from 3,500 m3 to below 3,250 m3 per batch (as well as natural gas usage for steam production). At roughly 100 batches per year, this opportunity represents a cost savings of approximately $125,000 per year. A number of projects, such as this one, will be implemented as a result of completing the ISO 50001 certification project.

The Green Chemistry Program intent is to remove more toxic ingredient from product manufacturing allowing for greater water reuse and reduced waste. One example is with an MPA contaminated process waste. Due to the contamination, this waste is collected and transported off site for treatment (incineration) rather than sold as a fertilizer or composted by others. Currently 125 m3 wastewater is collected per batch and this volume is expected to double over the next few years as production expands. By implementing a MPA segregation process, the contaminated wastewater can be reduced to approx. 67% per batch (savings up to 8,000 m3) and reducing disposal costs by roughly $500,000.

As part of the HillerÃ¸d Symbiosis Biogen has identified an opportunity for saving chemicals for neutralization of the wastewater. This is cooperation with the public wastewater treatment plant who is establishing a new wastewater treatment plant in HillerÃ¸d. As part of this establishment a pipe is going to be installed from the old wastewater treatment plan to the new one â€“ passing by Biogen. If we are a part of the pipe we do not need to neutralize the wastewater before discharge due to the larger quantity wastewater that will pass by us. This is a great saving for the environment (chemicals) and for us (resources in terms of FTE work).
Our process engineers, facilities and EHS+S staff also work continually to maintain and improve upon the high-quality water used in our processes. For example, our HillerÃ¸d facility completed an innovation fund project â€“ funded through our Strategic Innovation office â€“ addressing the reuse of process water. This project is being evaluated for implementation at other sites, including the new facility in Solothurn, Switzerland.
Biogen has a strategy to expand use of non-potable water to reduce demand on the local municipal fresh water systems. This strategy reduces Biogen's operational cost and improves relations with the local community and regulators as it demonstrates Biogen's desire to minimize its demand on local resources. Biogen first implemented this strategy in 2013 at its RTP Drug Substance facility through the incorporate of grey water from the City of Cary for irrigation purposes rather than using fresh water. RTP Drug Substance also installed a rainwater collection system to replace fresh water use for non-potable applications. Biogen continues to implement this strategy as it evaluates the cost to tie-in the use of grey water at its RTP Drug Product facility for irrigation and potentially even for cooling towers. The current financial impacts of this opportunity are $35,000 per year with the potential to increase upwards of $100,000 per year.

The current financial impacts of this opportunity are $35,000 per year with the potential to increase upwards of $100,000 per year.
Biogen has a strategy to expand use of non-potable water to reduce demand on the local municipal fresh water systems. This strategy reduces Biogen's operational cost and improves relations with the local community and regulators as it demonstrates Biogen's desire to minimize its demand on local resources. Biogen first implemented this strategy in 2013 at its RTP Drug Substance facility through the incorporate of grey water from the City of Cary for irrigation purposes rather than using fresh water.

In areas of greater water risk, Brown-Forman continues to develop projects which will ultimately lower our water consumption and wastewater discharge, improving our efficiency and giving us an advantage over our competitors who may lack such efficiency.  Brown-Formanâ€™s water conservation and efficiency efforts have reduced costs directly by purchasing less water. As a result of our efficiency efforts during this reporting year, both our water withdrawal and water intensity (gal/product) has decreased. We estimate cost savings associated with this intensity reduction to be a moderate decrease in our global operating costs.

Global trade in grains and oilseeds is expected to increase to 600 million metric tons by 2050.  This increase will be driven in part by a rise in the trade of â€œvirtualâ€ waterâ€”water embedded in products such as agricultural commodities.   Bungeâ€™s diverse, global operations enable it both to promote and benefit from virtual water trade by supplying regions with water-intensive crops that cannot be efficiently produced locally.

Near-term dislocations in global agricultural trade flows due to climate or water related impacts on agricultural production and commodity availability present opportunities for Bunge to leverage its global asset network to serve customers and meet demand in times of shortage.
One of the opportunities has been the development of goals.  In FY2016, we reset our environmental goals to better reflect the company we are today and also to reflect longer-term and more aggressive absolute reductions. Our new water goal is to reduce water use by 20% by 2025.  We have also committed to reducing water use per unit of ingredient in our top 5 agricultural ingredients by 20% by 2020. These goals have led us to develop more efficient processes.
We believe in the importance of stakeholder engagement and it is part of our overall CSR and environmental strategy.  Understanding water risks and having strategies in place to mitigate such risks can help with these stakeholder relationships.
Having a goal helps us to embed sustainability throughout the organization and triggers water efficiency projects, which often results in cost savings.  In addition, this often triggers innovation.

We reduced our water consumption company-wide by 14% (per case of product sold) from 2008 to 2011. In 2012, we set a new goal to further reduce our water consumption by 20% per case of product sold by 2020 vs. 2011 base year. Five years into this new goal period, we have already reduced water consumption by 21% vs. this new goal (in addition to the 14% reduction achieved previously).  In 2012, we converted our namesake bleach to a 33% more concentrated formula. It also helps reduce our water footprint since it is 33% more concentrated and makes for more efficient distribution. As a result of our water audits at our 9 most water intensive manufacturing sites, we have budgeted for capital improvement projects to reduce water consumption and improve current utilization. In addition, we have several LEED certified sites globally which utilize water reduction strategies to minimize fresh water use and overall community impact. Water awareness training is conducted for all manufacturing employees in the United States and Latin America.

Additional information: Since 2002, we have reduced the water consumed per unit of production in the manufacture of our products by over 48% (excluding water in products). Our new 2020 goal will take us even further. We will reduce our manufacturing water intensity by half compared to 2002 and find ways to replenish water withdrawn in highly stressed regions. Colgate invests in water conservation strategies at our global facilities via our manufacturing capital program and by implementing our Water Stewardship Standard. The Standard outlines best practices to reduce and recycle water in our manufacturing sites. we also have a Global Manufacturing Water Reduction team focused on water reduction strategies and projects.Our LEED-certified manufacturing facilities utilize various water reduction strategies to minimize fresh-water use and overall community impacts. Additionally, to help increase support for the "5% for the Planet" capital funding initiative, Colgate developed a "True" Cost of Water tool. Developed with Rutgers University BusinessSchool and its Supply Chain Management Program,this is a manufacturing-based tool designed to help sites quantify some of the hidden costs of water such as pretreatment pumping and wastewater treatment, thereby increasing both economicand environmental opportunities for reduction. We continue to explore new ways to share the approach and learnings from our True Cost of Water Toolkit with industry, peers, government agencies and NGOs.

For Coca-Cola, water is at the heart of our business. In addition to being our primary ingredient, water is central to our manufacturing process and necessary to grow the agricultural ingredients on which we rely. Safe, accessible water is also essential to the health of people and communities, critical to ecosystems and indispensable for economic prosperityâ€”all things our business requires.We have a special interest in protecting local water sources that sustain communities because we share those very sources with the communities where we operate. The communities that host our bottling plants are also our consumer base, our marketplaceâ€”we almost always sell our products where we make them. So, our water stewardship program is grounded in responsibility, but we also have a vested business interest. If communities stay strong, our business will stay strong; if the watersheds we share with them are conserved, those communities, and our business, can thrive.

In 2012, CNX Water Assets LLC was created as a vehicle to develop water related services, evaluate emerging water treatment technologies, champion the reuse of treated mine water, and pursue a strategic approach to our water asset management.  In 2015, CNX Water Assets became CONVEY Water Systems (CONVEY).  CONVEY manages produced water from our E&P operations with the goal of reducing disposal volumes and the use of freshwater, and increasing the use of recycled water in well drilling activities.
CONSOL Energy serves as a model for other operators in the Appalachian Basin by committing to following the CRSD standards, which go above and beyond federal and state regulation.  We hope to serve as a model for other companies in the region, and build trust among a diverse, cross-section of stakeholders by operating beyond a compliancemindset.  All producers in the Appalachian Basin are able to apply for CRSD certification, but CONSOL Energy is one of the few that has taken the challenge and become certified to all 15 standards.

We continue to investigate and implement strategies for reducing water use while continuing to produce brands of the highest quality and managing water risk as part of our business strategy. This is not only true of our operations in California, but also at facilities worldwide where we are actively managing and reducing our use of water consumption. We have conducted facility water balances for our wineries in California to identify 'hot spots' of water usage to understand how to directly focus on where we can make the most impact on water initiatives at site level. Additionally, the Blue Team at Franciscan Estate Winery has developed innovative sanitation and water reduction strategies. Water reduction efforts include: reuse of water from last rinse of one tank to first rinse of next tank, capturing second rinse on the barrel line and reusing for first barrel rinse, and monitoring ozone machine usage to reduce first rinse time.  The Blue Team also devised a new sanitation plan: reducing the CIO2 concentration in combination with the recharging of caustic for second tank cleaning and reusing citric acid washes, when possible. It is estimated that the site saves 545 gallons of water per sanitation cycle based on the new procedure. Franciscan Estate also installed 15 additional water meters throughout the property to ensure proper water usage and granular data recording, which is one of their tracked KPIs.
Water reduction initiatives are part of an ongoing continuous improvement objective of Bedford Barrel Warehouse, which added a water recovery and reuse system on a new barrel line. Rinse water from the second washer is captured, reheated and used as the water source for the primary barrel washers. This is estimated to save close to half of the water used at the site to wash the roughly 35,000 barrels used each year.

Although First Solar PV solutions are already competitive with conventional electricity generation sources in many regions on a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) basis, solar PV becomes even more competitive on a total cost of electricity basis. Total cost electricity pricing accounts for all externalities by including environmental and performance adders such as life cycle pollutant emissions, water use, and variable power. On a total cost basis, First Solar thin film PV has the lowest energy pricing per MWh due to our low environmental impact and power plant controller capabilities which help reduce costs of variable power by regulating real and reactive power output from the PV plant. Total cost methodology provides an alternative framework to subsidies for recognizing the societal benefits of clean energy when choosing between technology options. (Source: P. Sinha, M. de Wild-Scholten, A. Wade, C. Breyer, Total Cost Electricity Pricing of Photovoltaics, SmartGreenScans, First Solar, and Renoir Lemoine Institute, 2013.)

Hudbayâ€™s mine sites in Manitoba have access to an ample supply of freshwater resources. From an operations perspective, access to reliable sources of water is beneficial because it minimizes the capital costs and logistical difficulties associated with acquiring this resource.
Hudbayâ€™s mine site in Peru (Constancia) has access to plentiful water resources. From an operations perspective, access to reliable sources of water is beneficial because it minimizes the capital costs and logistical difficulties associated with acquiring this resource.
Hudbay's advanced exploration site in Arizona (Rosemont) is in a desert region with restricted access to water. Therefore, we plan to implement technologies, such as dry-stack tailings, to minimize water use. We also plan to replace all groundwater pumped with replacement surface waters from the Central Arizona Project (CAP). Our team conducted extensive baseline studies of surface and groundwater conditions in the project area and has incorporated considerations of these conditions into the development of the design as well as future management and mitigation plans for Rosemont.

Lockheed Martin has reduced absolute water usage by 24% from 2010-2016. Lockheed Martin's water management is focused on attaining the Corporationâ€™s Go Green goal for water conservation through increased efficiency, on-site water re-use, and best management practices at all facilities. Our strategy is expanding to place a stronger focus on initiatives in water-stressed regions.
As an example, in 2015, Lockheed Martin was awarded a contract by global tidal energy leader Atlantis Resources Ltd. to produce and integrate major elements of a next-generation 1.5-megawatt tidal turbine, the AR1500, as Phase 1a of the MeyGen tidal energy project. The technology will initially support the MeyGen project in Scotlandâ€™s Pentland Firth and deployment in Canadaâ€™s Bay of Fundy. Once completed, the MeyGen project â€“ the worldâ€™s largest tidal stream project under development â€“ will encompass up to 265 tidal turbines and is expected to deliver up to 398 MW of power, which is enough energy to power 200,000 homes, significantly reducing Scope 2 emissions. The MeyGen project will contribute to Scotlandâ€™s goal of 100 percent renewable energy by 2020.
Data from NOAAâ€™s GOES-R satellites provides accurate real-time weather forecasts and early warning products to NOAAâ€™s National Weather Service and other public and private sectors.

Marriottâ€™s water conservation initiatives address various aspects of hotel operations, including: laundry and linen/terry re-use programs; dishwashing and water service at restaurants and events; central plant operations; landscaping/irrigation; and golf course maintenance/operation. In addition to water-use efficiency efforts, there are also systems in place to capture greywater and rainwater for appropriate uses.
Marriott recently established a standard for water sub-meter for cooling towers and irrigation at its managed, full-service properties in the Americas. Where installed, these meters give a more detailed view of water consumption and aid in the early detection of leaks.
Marriott uses Green Hotels Globalâ„¢, an online dashboard to collect data and report the water, waste and carbon footprint of its managed and franchised hotels. The Marriott hotels in Green Hotels Globalâ„¢ are now also part of TripAdvisorâ€™s GreenLeaders rating system. For the second year, Marriott had the largest number of hotels included as GreenLeaders on TripAdvisor in 2016. Marriott also engages its top corporate customers through events at headquarters as well as in direct conversation to share best practices and provide water footprint data. In 2016, this engagement included materiality assessments with key customers to help refine our sustainability strategy.
Marriottâ€™s family of associates is vital to the success of our environmental strategy. We constantly develop new ways of engaging our associates in sustainability as a mindset and a way of working.  We provide standards and training on practices such as green meetings, operational best practices, recycling and waste reduction, and linen and terry re-use to associates worldwide. We communicate regularly through a variety of internal and external channels, such as our corporate, public affairs, and career/recruiting twitter handles and Facebook pages, executive blogs, bring in outside experts and thought leaders through the SERVE Our World speaker series and Innovation Week at headquarters and company-wide Environmental Awareness Month and Earth Hour activities. Our Corporate Social Responsibility pages on Marriott.com highlight our environmental vision to prospective job seekers. For the past two years, 85% of our associates confirmed Marriottâ€™s reputation for sustainability through our Associate Engagement Survey.

Our Water Management Standard, which sets the minimum requirements to proactively plan, manage & monitor our risks & performance throughout the mine lifecycle to protect human health, the environment &water resources.  Through our global water strategy, we work to fully understand the watersheds where we operate; participate in addressing watershed challenges for communities, other water users and the operation; and transparently report on our performance. The strategy also more clearly links technical and scientific water management practices with our long-term strategic and social responsibility objectives, including managing our human rights risks.  As our operations are located across the world, each operating site has different water needs and challenges depending on the supply, demand and water quality within the watershed. Because risks and impacts vary, we develop site-specific water management charters, which help sites define how to assess their risks and continually improve their water management.

In Nevada, efforts to reduce the use of potable water included the installation of a third tailings barge pump at Phoenix to increase the millâ€™s use of reclaimed water; and increased recycling of mill water at Twin Creeks. We also partnered with state and federal agencies to drill a 1,775-foot-deep carbonate test well, and during the year we conducted a 30-day stress test on the Long Canyon regional carbonate aquifer. The test evaluated the content and characteristics of the groundwater system over which our Long Canyon operation resides. Information from the test is being used to define local water characteristics, provide inputs to groundwater models and inform our conservation plans for the site. During the year, the Nevada Division of Water Resources, the Nevada Mining Association â€“ in which a Newmont representative chairs its Water Working Group â€“ and Newmont collaborated on designing a water rights process for post-mining pit lakes and associated evaporative loss of water from defined hydraulic basins.

APS's closure of coal units (820 megawatts retired since 2013) has resulted in the reduction of water consumption by approximately 20%. APS plans to retire an additional 767 megawatts of coal by 2025, which is projected to further reduce water consumption at the Cholla Power Plant to less than 10% of current consumption. Shift in load from coal to natural gas will result in significant water savings as the water intensity (gallons/megawatt hour) at gas plants is less than half of the coal plant water intensity. Continued development of renewable energy such as PV solar and wind will reduce fleet wide water intensity. When combined with reduction in coal generation plus the retirement of steam units at Ocotillo (replaced with more efficient combustion turbines), APS expects fleet wide water intensity reductions of 20% by 2025.
APS investment in water for the future includes purchase of effluent under contracts through 2050 for Palo Verde and Redhawk, to be extended if needed.  It also includes purchase of long term storage credits from the Gila River Indian Community to supply high priority water to the Sundance Power Plant.
Retirement of steam units at Ocotillo and replacement with more efficient combustion turbines, cooled by hybrid cooling will reduce water consumption significantly.  Water intensity will improve from 1000 g/mwh to 140 g/mwh.
APS established a Well and Pumping Equipment Reliability Program in 2015 that encompasses critical components of the water supply, including groundwater wells, well testing and inspection, pump testing, well infrastructure inspection (including pumps and motors, meters and lubrication systems). Expected improvements in reliability of 2%/year are being tracked.
In 2015, Well Field Management Plans were developed for a portion of the fleet and are being implemented, tested, and revised.  These plans will result in more efficient use of higher quality groundwater, decreased water consumption, and more strategic use of water resources.

In our home state of California, where the bulk of our customers reside, water and energy are typically managed separately despite the important links between the two. Water is used in the production of nearly every major energy source. Likewise, energy is used in multiple ways and at multiple steps in water delivery and treatment systems as well as wastewater collection and treatment. As a result, utilities receive financial incentives for the successful implementation of energy-efficiency programs that often reduce water use as well, through energy and water-efficient appliances and equipment. To the extent our customers become more focused on reducing energy and water use, this provides our California utilities with more opportunities to save natural resources and earn financial incentives, as available.
Sempra has taken many steps to minimize water use in our operations. This includes using reclaimed water and dry-cooling at our power plants and photovoltaic cells made that convert sunlight directly into electricity without the use of water. As water becomes an increasingly scarce resource and Sempra and its business units are recognized for taking action to reduce water use, this can positively impact our reputation, making it easier to do business and get new projects permitted and approved.
Our SDG&E and SoCalGas business units are reducing water use at employee-occupied facilities through equipment upgrades, in addition to water-saving measures for landscaping, including drought-tolerant plants and weather-based irrigation. We also utilize water-saving technologies for power generation, including photovoltaic cells that generate electricity from sunlight without using water.  When we save water, we also reduce energy use, further reducing costs and impacts to the environment.

Our first priority is to ensure the wholesomeness and safety of our food products, and water is essential to producing safe food. We recognize water of suitable quality and volume is a finite resource. We also understand the important balance between protecting product quality and conserving a natural resource. Success in this area requires a holistic approach to water stewardship beginning with the responsible use of this resource at our operations, and maintaining a goal helps us ensure water stewardship is embraced by all employees. In FY16, we experienced an almost seven-percent increase in water usage. This increase is due to a decrease in overall production resulting from various facility renovation and upgrades during the year, combined with enhanced food safety measures.

The targets designed with WRI will eventually involve collaborating with the companyâ€™s entire supply chain, including material and ingredient suppliers, and the farmers who raise and supply Tyson with chicken, turkey, cattle and pigs.
Northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri are home to more 14,000 Tyson Foods team members, eight processing plants, and more than 800 contract farmers. The company's water footprint in this area is significant and we have an important responsibility to conserve our precious natural resources for the communities in which we live and work.
Water is essential to our ability to both obtain the raw materials for, and production of, safe food. We recognize water of suitable quality and volume is a finite resource. Success in this area requires a holistic approach to water stewardship including impacting how our wastewater discharges impact the environment. We believe these efforts provide us the opportunity to reduce our environmental impact over time so both Tyson and its suppliers can benefit now, and other generations will benefit in the future.
Our first priority is to ensure the wholesomeness and safety of our food products, and water is essential to producing safe food. We recognize water of suitable quality and volume is a finite resource. We also understand the important balance between protecting product quality and conserving a natural resource. Success in this area requires a holistic approach to water stewardship beginning with the responsible use of this resource at our operations, and maintaining a goal helps us ensure water stewardship is embraced by all employees. In FY16, we experienced an almost seven-percent increase in water usage. This increase is due to a decrease in overall production resulting from various facility renovation and upgrades during the year, combined with enhanced food safety measures.
We recognize the importance of water management and stewardship in both our direct operations and supply chain.

Performance contracting is basically receiving a guaranteed energy and water savings to offset facility and infrastructure renewal project costs. It allows customers to make capital improvements, save energy and water, reduce emissions, improve sustainability and address tight budgets â€“ and use the expected utility and operational savings to offset the cost of the upgrades.  The savings are guaranteed, so risks to the customer are minimal.  We see a growing opportunity to meet customersâ€™ resource efficiency needs, including water efficiency.  Currently our total Building Efficiency business across all products and services represents 36% of our enterprise revenue.
Advanced Meter Reading (AMR)/Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) from Johnson Controls can help improve cash flow, reduce water losses, protect property, preserve system capacity and cut operating costs by avoiding:  system leaks, leaks at customer sites, damaged or broken meters, and tampering/theft issues. We see a growing opportunity to meet customersâ€™ resource efficiency needs, including water efficiency.  Currently our total Building Efficiency business across all products and services represents 36% of our enterprise revenue.
According the the World Resources Institute's (WRI) "Accelerating Building Efficiency" study, buildings are responsible for nearly 40 percent of energy use (including 60 percent of electricity use) and 12 percent of water use throughout the world, so there are significant opportunities to help customers save both water and energy, and also to save water within our own operations including our plants and buildings. We see a growing opportunity to meet customersâ€™ resource efficiency needs, including water efficiency.  Currently our total Building Efficiency business across all products and services represents 36% of our enterprise revenue.
This customer project helps reduce both water and energy consumption. Johnson Controls together with Affiliated Engineers, Inc., helped Stanford engineers deliver a custom-engineered heat-recovery process that is 70 percent more efficient than the cogeneration process Stanford used since 1987. York heat-recovery chillers will meet more than 90 percent of campus heating demands by capturing almost two-thirds of the waste heat generated by the campus cooling system to produce hot water for the heating system.  Along with a Metasys building automation system, Johnson Controls developed the Enterprise Optimization System, a predictive control software system to optimize cost and energy use based on the 10 day weather forecast and future grid electricity prices. The software is designed to predict hourly campus heating and cooling needs, and then determine how to best run the heat recovery, heating, and cooling equipment inside. It also will determine how much hot and cold water to store in the CEF's water thermal storage tanks for later use. While it is a fact that our water conservation efforts for customers are still smaller when compared to our energy conservation business, we have seen a growing demand for them.

Our corporate campus in Glendale, Wisconsin was awarded LEEDÂ® Platinum certification.  The 33-acre site showcases our energy-efficient and sustainable building products and services. Since the renovation, energy and water usage has been reduced significantly, despite the doubling of office space by over 160,000 square feet. Some of the sustainable features include: A 30,000-gallon cistern captures rainwater from all new roof surfaces for reuse, reducing potable water consumption for new bathroom fixtures by 77 percent, and by about 6% campus-wide. Solar generation produces the electricity needed in the new buildings while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A 1,330 ft2 solar thermal installation on the roof annually saves 2,837 therms of energy. Skylights and increased window space reduce the use of energy for indoor lighting.  Our corporate headquarters in Shanghai has received the first-ever EDGE design-phase certification for an office building in China. EDGE, which stands for â€œExcellence in Design for Greater Efficiency,â€ is a green building certification system from IFC-World Bank Group; for its energy, water, and material savings. Innovations incorporated into the new building include solar PV panels which will help regulate energy usage during peak times, high efficiency chillers to maintain comfortable temperatures and Johnson Controlâ€™s MetasysÂ® integrated building management system.
To achieve this goal, several projects across our facilities are dedicated to improve water efficiency, such as detecting and repairing water leaks, or recalibrating flow meters. There's also a water assessment in our Johnson Controls Manufacturing System (JCMS) Maturity Model within the Environment and Sustainability principle. A project example, would be how our York test lab established a team to identify, quantify and assign value for possible water savings opportunities when testing chillers for leaks using water. Ways to recycle the test water were identified resulting in an annual of about 456,600 gallons. Our Building Efficiency Wuxi plant in China is an example of great water savings projects. During 2015, they saved 27,000 m3 by fixing 20 year old pipes that had leaks. They also added monitoring meters which helped the team identify any additional leaks. Additionally, they saved 25,000 m3 by fixing fire hydrant system pipes that were also old and had leaks. During 2016, the plant planned on carrying out product testing without the use of water, which amounted to 0.5% usage savings annually. Our current goal is to reduce our water intensity by 5% by 2020 from a 2014 baseline.
Our global facilities identify energy efficiency and water conservation projects and through the use of the Best Business Practice/Continuous Improvement (BBP/CI) management system, they track and manage improvement projects at their facility. We also leverage these tools to run reports for all energy efficiency and water conservation projects being implemented globally. Although our water costs are lower than our energy costs, reducing our water use also reduces our water costs and presents additional operational savings to our business.

Continuance of existing water rights at select locations allows Union Pacific to cost effectively use water in our operations. A good example is the maintenance of tree lines previously discussed.
Union Pacific accesses most major grain markets, linking the Midwest and Western U.S. producing areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast ports, as well as Mexico. Therefore, changes in precipitation extremes can be an opportunity for Union Pacific. In 2016, severe rains throughout South Texas caused flooding which created up to 72 hour delays for freight delivery.  These events have huge financial impact on our operations, in the millions of dollars.
Providing water to vegetation along our tracks.  It is extremely important to our Board of Directors that we obtain a secure source of water for our operations.

Decreasing use of water either by optimization of manufacturing processes or by recycling or reusing water could result in reduced cost to manufacture goods or offer services to customers from both reduced water supply costs and in many cases reduced energy costs.
We recognize opportunity in business resumption challenges experienced by others impacted by adverse weather through increased demand for some of our offerings. As the frequency of extreme weather events increases, impacts such as precipitation extremes /flooding may be partially offset by revenue opportunities associated with Xeroxâ€™s business continuity products whereby Xerox can keep customers â€œup and runningâ€ after they have been impacted. Increased demand for Xeroxâ€™s cloud based products would result in increased revenue to Xerox.XeroxÂ® DocuShareÂ® Private Cloud Service manages and stores information in a secure central repository, in the cloud, which provides access to business critical content both online and offline. This ensures the safety and availability of our customerâ€™s data at any time including if customers have been impacted by adverse weather or other disruptive events. When an organization gets its technical infrastructure and software as a service through a cloud, the potential for a significant weather related disaster to shut down the services or loose data is low.In addition, as the environmental awareness of consumers increases it creates a demand for sustainable products. With an embodied water footprint of 2-13 liters per A4 sheet, paper is a water intensive product.  This presents opportunities for Xerox to develop more document management and cloud based products that reduce paper reduction and in turn help customers reduce their water footprint.

Wyndham has many water efficiency and conservation activities currently focused on low-to-no cost measures and behavioral changes based on sustainability education.  The most successful program that has resulted in significant savings both in water withdrawals and costs has been the Wyndham Vacation Ownership Green Certification Program.  The program is an internal certification with strict adherence to quality assurance around sustainability initiatives including water reduction. Additionally, we achieved water conservation gains through our Wyndham Green Supplier Programs.We also work closely with third-party franchisees to reduce their water impacts. Our Green Franchisee Advisory Board is a cross-brand team where both brand owners and general managers showcase, test and share best practices to advance sustainability in the hotel group portfolio. We offered various training and educational workshops about the Wyndham Green Program, impacting almost 8,000 franchisees, through the Wyndham Hotel Group Global Conference. Additionally, the Champions of Green Panel has been established to enable group of franchisees that shared experiences on implementing sustainable practices at their properties.In 2016, Wyndhamâ€™s water withdrawals were approximately 48 gallons per square foot, declining 20% towards our fifteen-year goal of 25% in the first four years.
Wyndham actively communicates and reports on its water performance, programs and plans through its website and annual Sustainability Reports. To date, our sustainability program has been recognized as industry leading by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and Newsweek Green Rankings.  We also engage through our global associate base through several strategic, multi-year initiatives, which include: (1) Wyndham Green Council structured to train, educate, track and motivate our associates to develop and implement innovative solutions, (2) The â€œCaught Green Handedâ€ program recognizing associates who have provided triple bottom line benefits within the Wyndham Destination Network and Wyndham Vacation Ownership businesses, (3) Sustainability 101 Training, a learning module that has trained over 72% of associates worldwide on water conservation practices.Wyndham also actively pursue green certifications (both external and internally-developed). To date, Wyndham Hotel Group has over 500 franchised and managed sites that have received certifications such as Green Key, Green Globe, LEEDÂ® and others. The RCI Green Awards recognition in Australia, North America and Europe, began by Wyndham Destination Network to drive sustainable practices in resort development, is one of the first in the industry.

In 2016, markets reported nearly 600 buildings meeting the standard. As a result of this work over the first year of operation, these buildings will save approximately 1.2 MM dollar from water conservation measures.
As mentioned above, stores built to Yum! Brandsâ€™ Blueline green building standards provide our foundational guidance to markets regarding water conservation.  These projects are selected and implemented by the markets. For example in the Netherlands, restaurants are using improved equipment to reduce water for building consumption and for process functions that is saving over $5,000 per store annually.
Dedicated resources, including our Chief Sustainability Officer and Global Sustainability team, and our brand and division teams, work together to build brands people trust and champion â€“ this is no different when it comes to water conservation. Our cross functional teams help ensure that we are always working to introduce new technology and initiatives to make restaurants in our local communities better stewards of the natural resources we use to run our stores. For example, our KFC Australia market is very focused on water conservation and introduced water-saving measures including water efficient landscaping, high efficiencywater faucets and restroom fixtures, and rainwater harvesting tanks. Globally, Australia, China, India, South Africa, Turkey, and USA all have at least one equity store classified as a high risk site that could benefit from improved water stewardship.
Many SRI investors are signatories to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, which represents over $60 trillion in assets under management. Many of Yum! Brandsâ€™ top shareholders belong to this initiative.
Our community engagement process is critical to long-term business viability in the Elk River watershed. More information on this can be found at: http://www.teck.com/responsibility/approach-to-responsibility/our-sustainability-strategy/

The manufacturing of glass containers is not seen as being very sensitive to climate change. For example: We use abundant raw materials, recycled glass, are not large users of water, are generally not affected by adverse weather conditions, and are the only material that can be widely refilled. This could translate to increased differentiation among the competition if significant climate changes occur.

In 2015, our Cerro Verde operation, as part of a large-scale mine expansion, completed construction of a wastewater treatment plant for the city of Arequipa, Peru.  This plant improves regional water quality, reduces waterborne illnesses and enhances the value of local agricultural products while providing water for this operational expansion.  Cerro Verde also funded the development of an expandable water treatment facility which now provides local residents 24-hour access to potable water.

Recharge is a means of storing excess renewable water supplies so that they may be used in the future. Artificial recharge and the use of GSFs is an increasingly important tool in the management of Arizonaâ€™s water supplies.  Storing water underground to ensure an adequate supply for the purpose of satisfying current and future needs is both practical and cost-effective in our desert environment.  This exercise also results in reducing current groundwater demands in the state while encouraging the development of beneficial partnerships between various entities across the diverse water use sectors in Arizona.

In December 2015, the U.S. Secretary of Interior Sally Jewel issued a Record of Decision that finalized the Bill Williams Water Rights Settlement Act of 2014 (Act).  The Act provided for a settlement of water rights disputes between the Hualapai Tribe (Tribe), the United States (acting on behalf of the Tribe), Freeport's Bagdad operation, and the State of Arizona's Game and Fish Department in the Bill Williams River watershed in Arizona.  The settlement provides the Tribe with the means to purchase future water supplies to Tribal members. Additionally, the settlement provided for the transfer of a portion of Freeport's Planet Ranch property and water rights to support the Multi-Species Conservation Program (MSCP).  The MSCP is a multi-state mitigation program that sets aside lands for species and habitat conservation to offset water and power operations in the Lower Colorado River Basin.  The settlement further provides each party with protection against future water rights disputes and litigation.  Finally, the settlement secures Freeport's water rights for over 70% of Bagdad's make-up water supplies.  The company is now entering a second phase settlement with the various regulatory agencies to obtain legal certainty for the remaining 30% of Bagdad's make-up water supplies.

Efficient water management is one component for Corporate Policy of â€œGetting Doing it rightâ€ for all  practices at the mine.  Recycling of water reduces the need for treatment and discharge and the associated costs.  Proactive water management reduces the risks for closure and  hence reduces the risks of larger closure costs due to contamination of surface and /or groundwater.       Key performance indicator for operations is the regular update and reporting of the water balance against targets

Costs spent to date are $1.5 M on this research.
By installing these features, we are attempting to control water consumption. As an example, by having hands-free (sensor) faucets installed we are eliminating the potential of having faucets run for longer than needed, thus reducing water consumption. In 2016 our headquarter office in Chicago, our offices in Schaumburg and our facility in Elgin, utilize water efficient fixtures.

Over the past five years, we have increased water efficiency in our Mexico operations. We have also begun to assess the amount of water reuse that we incorporate into our operations as a method for identifying cost savings and efficiency gains.















There are several processes in which Delta Beverages could reduce water consumption resulting in cost savings. Improvements could be made to increase the efficiency of steam/condensate recovery systems in order to reduce make-up water required by the boilers used to generate process steam. Another area that could be improved to reduce water consumption is a cooling tunnel system which spray relatively cold water on bottles containing hot beverage product in order to bring down the temperature. The current system is an open-loop design in which fresh cold water is continuously sprayed onto the bottles. Delta is currently looking into the possibilities of closing this system and adding a refrigeration cycle. This will significantly impact Delta's water consumption, but add to energy consumption.

Review of water conservation projects during the annual budgeting process allows for opportunities to be routinely considered for endorsement and implementation (by either financial justification or the corporate EHS fund). Also, the current predominantly favorable availability and quality of water in areas of our operations allows AbbVie to business plan for longer-term periods - which for AbbVie and its core business is a competitive advantage that increases shareholder value.Also, AbbVie retains a well-experienced EHS staff with nominal turnover/high retention. This perpetuity allows year-over project reviews to assess effectiveness based on historical knowledge of a process/project.

Many of our operations sites are in process of planning or installing wastewater treatment systems for our waterborne wash and other water-based wastes. The treated water is planned initially for discharge to WWTP but there are future plans for reuse into process water systems and ultimately, back into our product. This will take time to implement and to realize water use reduction,

The Board has delegated primary responsibility for the oversight of risks facing the company to the Audit Committee. The 3M Company Board of Directors Audit Committee Charter states that the committee will ''discuss policies and procedures with respect to risk assessment and risk management, the company's major risk exposures, and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate such exposures.â€ For the purposes of discussing water-related risks, ''substantive financial impactâ€ means an event or circumstance that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or operations of 3M Company and subsidiaries and affiliates taken as a whole. The Vice President and General Auditor, Corporate Auditing, whose appointment and performance is reviewed and evaluated by the Audit Committee, is responsible for leading the formal risk assessment and management process within the company. The Auditor, consulting with the company's senior management, annually assesses the major risks facing the company and works with those executives responsible for managing each specific risk. The Auditor periodically reviews with the Audit Committee the major risks facing the company and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate those risks. While the Board's oversight of risk is primarily performed by the Audit Committee, the Board has also delegated to other 3M senior management committees the oversight of risks within their areas of responsibility and expertise. The EHS Committee of 3M senior management provides input on climate and environmental related risks. The Science, Technology, and Sustainability Committee regularly reviews sustainability programs and issues as part of their mission. The committee will assess and advance strategic growth areas, long-term investments, and Sustainability â€“ inspired innovation opportunities. See W6.2a a for more details. We believe this governance of risks by Board committees, who share information with the full Board, is appropriate for a diversified technology and manufacturing company like 3M. 3M's 10-K, Item 1A, outlines risk factors applicable to the company.
Substantive change is defined as any event which could impact our direct operations or supply chain to a degree that it would significantly interrupt product flow to our customers in any of the global markets that we serve. Abbott's established Enterprise Risk Management Process evaluates risks based on the impacts of margin combined with reputational risk and impact on other segments of the business. While water is a key resource for our operations and supply chain, geographic diversification helps to mitigate this risk. Abbott's diversified business model has wide geographical distribution designed to significantly mitigate the impact of any single event. Abbott constantly shapes its portfolio to ensure that we are in the right markets and success is not over reliant on a single therapy, technology or country. In 2017, Abbott had over 80 manufacturing sites located throughout the World and over 82,000 suppliers. Abbott's Enterprise Risk Management Process supports the Board in risk oversight and Abbott leadership in risk management. The process is designed to identify potential events that could impact the company and manage risk within our risk tolerances. Risks related to weather or other natural events are monitored and responded to daily, while regulatory and customer issues are managed at a frequency consistent with the issue. Key action plans to address critical risks and opportunities are typically managed as goals and progress is monitored throughout the year with formal performance reviews. Any issue with immediate business impact is quickly elevated to senior management levels while long-term business risk and opportunity issues are managed and elevated to the appropriate level of management as part of structured annual planning processes. For our direct operations, we use the WBCSD Global Water and WRI Aqueduct tools are used in concert to identify the risk level for sites on an annual basis as follows: Sites that are ''Extreme Scarcityâ€ or ''Scarcityâ€ for renewable water supply are classified as water stressed. In 2017, 36% of Abbott's manufacturing sites operated in water-stressed regions, with their water use representing 17% of our total (absolute) water intake. These sites reduced their water intake by 8% from 2016 to 2017. The limited amount of water consumed in water-stressed regions reflects that most of our sites operating in water-stressed basins are relatively low-water-intensity operations. Abbott also proactively identifies suppliers in high-risk industries, geographies and spend categories, conducting intensive screening in emerging markets. We assess sustainability risk through our Supplier Classification Model (SCM), which guides our Supplier Social Responsibility Program, and through the Supplier mapping risk matrix tool -- DHL Resilience 360, which has a Sustainability Index as a component of its wider risk index. Critical suppliers are then mapped against water stress using the WRI Aqueduct Tool. Through this process, we are able to identify which suppliers are more likely to have water-related risks that could have a substantive impact to allow us effective monitor and manage these accounts.
Any risk that , if realized, would result in a disruption to assure supply of our therapies and the inability to make a positive remarkable impact for our customers would also be considered a substantive financial and strategic business impact. In this light, the inability to access water or the scarcity of proper water purity (as an input to our processes) would represent such an impact.
At ADTRAN an Enterprise Risk Management is defined.
Water supply for the heap leach operation at La India is crucial for the continued operation. We have alternative supplies but they may be affected by very dry years and only during the dry season.
Material impacts are generally defined as capital expenditures greater than $10,000,000, operating expense increases greater than $5,000,000 annually or strategic plan impacts of greater than $10,000,000. Additionally the 2017 year-to-date water compliance record of the company is nearly perfect and we have no concerns with meeting applicable water quality standards. Additionally, no new water quality standards have been proposed that represent a material risk to the company and would require additional controls greater than $10 million in capitalexpenditures.
Our risk-management process is structured around the Integrated Framework for Enterprise Risk Management and using ISO 31000 (risk management). as a guideline. We use the process to identify and evaluate a broad spectrum of risks using our key business drivers and organizational goals to ensure that all aspects of the business have been covered. Business drivers include our reputation, brand, earnings and operating margins. Organizational goals include excellence in stewardship of the environment, health and safety, a consistently fair representation of financial information, organic growth and more. The identified risks are grouped into risk areas and presented to management to determine how they should be prioritized. Our process is multi-dimensional and focuses on several aspects, including likelihood of occurrence, level of impact and mitigating risk factors. Each is considered in assessing and prioritizing risk, with more emphasis placed on likelihood and impact. The collaborative process by which risks are identified, evaluated and managed ensures that senior management remains aware and vigilant in managing key risks that could impact the company.The Alcoa Board of Directors maintains oversight of our risk management, and our management reports on specific risks on a periodic basis. A discussion of our significant risks can be found starting on page 28 of our 2017 Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2017. The annual report and 10-K can be found online at: http://investors.alcoa.com/financial-reports/annual-reports-and-proxy-statements. Shortages of water are mentioned on page 38 under the Climate change risk factor.Scarcity of water has been added to the list of key risks in our Enterprise Risk Management process. The ERM supports several objectives inside the risk management area. We use this process to foster a risk management philosophy to the leadership of the company. We also use it to identify, prioritize, monitor and mitigate the key risks that Alcoa faces into its day-to-day activities. ERM is used to ensure the communication among Alcoa business units, resource units, executive team and board of directors in matters related to risk.
Several Allergan locations have experienced droughts. Water is delivered into the areas from several other locations to supplement the demand from the area. Reuse of treated effluent to supplement existing groundwater resources has been instituted over the past four years in southern California. Plans for mandatory water curtailment and water rationing were developed for these sites. Water costs continue to climb as the resource becomes more restricted. There have been no impacts to Allergan product manufacturing nor revenues as a result of these droughts to date. The water cost increases have been minimal when compared to other utility costs such as electricity and fuel. However, in Brazil, electricity is tied to water availability due to the high reliance on hydroelectric power in the country. Droughts in Brazil do impact the electrical costs as well as the water costs, and are therefore more substantial.
See 10-K report, beginning page 3 at www.aointl.comSeasonal rainfall fluctuations may affect the volume and quality of crop production on farms within our supply chain. We judge the risk to our business as low at this time due to our flexibility to source from other origins.A substantive change could require alternative product sourcing from other locations and we have proven global supply chains to deliver this flexibility.
Altria and its operating companies discuss Risk Factors posed to its operations and supply chain as federally required in financial reporting instruments such as our Form 10-K. Risks to Altria and its operating companies and supply chains regarding water and/or the environment include:-Natural or man-made disasters impacting one or more facilities or significant suppliers,-Significant changes in tobacco leaf prices, quality or availability driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns, and-Variations in Ste. Michelle's grape supply influenced by consumer demand for wine, industry-wide production levels as well as weather and crop conditions, influencing costs of production and pricing.These risks have the potential to influence operating costs for Altria Group's operating companies, and in the case of natural or man-made disasters; prolonged disruption in operations experienced by one or more of Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries. A change of this magnitude would be considered substantive â€“ the metric is increased operating costs and the threshold for discussion in financial reporting instruments such as our Form 10-K is based on both quantitative and qualitative factors.
Current risk is related to implementation of water regulations through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program for our energy centers, new EPA regulations pertaining to Clean Water Act section 316(b) and Effluent Limitations Guidelines as well as future regulatory actions associated with threatened and endangered species and Clean Water Act section 316(a). If major capital expenditures or increases in operating costs are required at energy centers based on the final rules, that would constitute a substantive change.
We use the same thought process for risk. Does this pose a material risk to the corporation and define that impact as 1% of sales.

AEP's common stock is publicly traded and the company is subject to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition to its regularly filed financial reports, AEP is required advise the SEC and the public within four business days of any event or development which would have a material impact on the companies. Generally these levels range between 5 to 15 percent of certain financial measures ( revenues, assets, or income) based on the most recent audited financial statements for the affected company. Developments that have an impact equal to or in excess of the applicable threshold must be reported within four days to the SEC and publicly announced.
Currently, greatest financial risk is associated with climbing cost of water supply and water discharge treatment expenses. Water availability concerns will be assessed in the coming two years, though water stress conditions are being closely monitored in California and Lisbon locations.
Potable water is a necessary resource to our manufacturing process. Should water become extremely scarce in regions where we manufacture ourproducts, it could potentially have an impact on our manufacturing operations. This potential risk has been identified at a functional level withinEnvironment, Health, Safety, and Sustainability and is considered a low potential risk.
We define the following water risk that have a significant impact on our company's business, operation, product and sales.We consider sites with water risk as those that, are located in the areas with water shortage based on FAO Aquastat and whose overall water risk under WRI Aqueduct is medium to high risk (2~3).Indicator used to define substantive impact include product/human loss, violation of regulation, damages to reputation, etcs.Threshold values used to determine whether there has been a substantive impact include occurrence of human injuries, violation of laws(fines, shutdown), and loss of product(<5% of product capacity and <1% total area of site)The definition applies only to direct operations. Our supply chain determines its risk based on its own business continuity plan.
Spend on water cost is not a substantial contributor to total operational costs.
A substantive change is a significant modification or expansion in the scope or nature of Anadarko's direct operations (not suppliers) at a field level, as measured by the level of activity or production of an asset from sourcing, management or disposal of water. Anadarko has a deep portfolio of opportunities in the U.S. onshore, most of which would be considered unconventional resource plays. As such, these assets require access to water for drilling and completions operations. Without an adequate supply of water, Anadarko and/or its suppliers would need to develop alternatives, allocate capital to other assets in its portfolio, and/or consider reducing the level of activity in a given play. The threshold amount of change necessary will differ among operational plays based upon the economics involved with therequired change. These considerations are a significant part of our investment, engagement and water-management strategies to ensure adequate supplies of and appropriate disposal of water at all of our U.S. onshore growth opportunities. Additionally, activity levels areevaluated continuously as part of our capital allocation process for each field. During this process, potential changes in operations and costs, including water availability, management and disposal, are considered.
At Applied Materials, we define substantive change as anything that could disrupt our business. Through our business continuity, risk management, and supply chain teams, we are continually re-evaluating and prioritizing potential risks. For new projects, we have an ongoing project review process and look for an ROI of 18 months for any capital expenditures. In the past, this has included some water efficiency projects or integrating water improvements into planned upgrades. For example, we undertook the Austin Industrial Waste Neutralization (IWN) Program, launched in September, 2015, has had a substantial impact on water usageâ€”a savings of approximately 3.8 million gallons in 2017.Prior to the IWN program, the Austin wet tool manufacturing operations tested waste distilled water and used reverse osmosis to neutralize the water and then discharged it to the City of Austin publically-owned treatment works (POTW). The IWN reclamation program reuses treated industrial wastewater in the cooling towers at the Austin manufacturing facility as make-up water. Each gallon of reclaimed IWN waste water added to the cooling towers for make-up directly replaces potable water that would otherwise have been used. Excess volumes of reclaimed waste water continue to flow through the lift station to the City of Austin POTW. During the cooler months, the recycled wastewater provides over 90 percent of the total cooling tower make-up water and augments the original make-up water source during hotter months.The area where we have some of the most substantive risks is to the evolution of our products. We work closely with our clients to understand how water is influencing their purchasing decisions. In addition, we follow the best practices in tool development and specifications for water outlined in the SEMI industry requirements.
Generally, Aptar utilize a risk assessment matrix which measures the likelihood and consequence of each aspect and impact we identify. As part of the Aptar Production System, which measures and tracks each facility along a progression path, each facility is responsible to determine aspects and impacts of the business and then to prioritize these aspects and impacts. A similar risk assessment model is used during the comprehensive Risk Assessment which is performed annually by the Vice President, Treasury and Risk Management. At the moment Aptar is mapping water data from each plant thanks to the specific software module, the EHS&S of each site upload each month the total quantity of water withdrawal and discharged. Appropriate and detailed quantification of these substantive impacts are on-going considering also the use of WBCSD water tool. In relationship to the water risk assessment we identify substantive impact related to the use of water in our core processes as for example injection molding operations. The problem related to the water use and quality could effect our organization including operational, financial and strategic effects due to changes in the molding activities and scenario. For example if the water availability in a certain locations could be effected by a drastically reduction or scarcity this could generate problem related to the cooling of molded components used in the finished product. This situation at the same time could generate delays or problem in the planning for the production of finished products to the Aptar customers. We rate our risk based on a measure of probability versus severity. A substantial ("substantive change") risk would be one that: - has a high level of probability, meaning most key factors contributing to the risk are present. There may be deficiencies in controls or procedures currently in place. Historically, the event has occurred with some frequency within Aptar or the industry. The event is considered likely to occur once every 1-5 years. - has a high level of severity, meaning the potential impact on cash flow and earnings is material and will directly impact Aptar's ability to meet strategic business objectives.We rank probability and severity from 0 (low) - 10 (high). Per this heat map, a "substantive change" would be an item that: -has severity 3.5 - 6.5 and probability of 6.5 or greater; -has probability of 3.5 - 6.5 and severity of 6.5 or greater; -or has a severity and a probability of greater than 6.5
Risk Management Program OverviewARC has a risk management system in place to identify, assess and prioritize risks to impact on business. A risk matrix to help provide guidance for identifying overall risk and to ensure hazard controls selected will effectively eliminate the hazard or reduce residual risk to tolerable levels if the risk level falls under intolerable the risk must be eliminate or mitigated with engineering and or administrative controls to be lower to risk ranking of medium or less within specific time period. The assessment utilizes severity and frequency to determine risk level. Risks categorized within the High Risk level would be defined as substantive impact on ARC's business as in many cases it would result in financial loss $1MM or higher, from an environmental perspective the ranking would include short term impacts to groundwater or surface water with localized effects.Corporate ImpactGiven ARC's size and structure impact mentioned above would be considered corporate wide and not associated with a business unit. This would also apply to all levels of the supply and value chains as losses can be experienced in all aspect of the operation as the result is to likely impact ARC.Rating DefinitionAs mentioned ARC assesses the severity of a risk as well as its likelihood for occurrence, the severity is ranked from minor (<$100K impact) to Catastrophic (>$10MM). It terms of the substantive impact the severity would be listed as Serious ($1MM-$5MM). To have a serious event ranked as high risk there should have to be a frequency assess of "likely" to "highly likely" which could occur 10 to >25 times per year. As far as completing tasks are concerned ARC would not proceed with a high risk activity unless the level can be brought down medium or low risk through controls being implemented.All risks are monitored and reviewed annually ensuring all action plans (controls) are developed, assigned an owner, implemented and monitored for effectiveness.
ADM defines substantive financial impact consistent with "material risks" as reported in its SEC filings.

Avery Dennison defines substantive change as impacts on revenue, stakeholders and costs as well as availability of purchased goods. Indicators we recognize as having potential substantive changes include 5% revenue, concerns expressed by key stakeholders, and cost increases as much as 5% (or significant risk of material availability). Any one of these elements or a combination thereof would be basis for evaluating mitigating measures. These elements impact supply chain.
We evaluate risks based on how our customers and society expect our products and services contribute to their respective sustainability goals. Axalta's Sustainability Council members represent all core staff functions and business segments of the company including those with lead responsibility for EHS-related issues. The significance of risks is determined by their impact on the availability of renewable resource as required by regulation, social norms or customer requirements. Finally, longer term we factor in potential developments in societal expectations and the consequent potential for new regulatory requirements based changing renewable resource availability.
For CDP reporting, we consider risks and opportunities with potential financial implications for our business of over $10 million per year to be substantive, which applies to both our direct operations and supply chain. The metric used to identify substantive change is financial impact in USD. The threshold indicating substantive change is $10 million per year.With offices in Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, China and Australia, our Asian and Australian operations are vulnerable to an increase in the severity, duration and/or frequency of tropical storms experienced in these regions. Our operations in the southern and eastern United States, including our headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, are also vulnerable to an increase in the severity, duration and frequency of seasonal storms and potential for severe weather conditions. We operate 4,000+ U.S. retail financial centers, some of which are vulnerable to the physical impacts of climate risk with the potential to disrupt the accessibility of our retail outlets to our clients. Physical risks in the U.S. take the form of increased frequency and severity of storms with related flooding, particularly affecting the coastal southern and eastern states, and extreme heat events resulting in drought conditions and numerous wildfires across the West, Central and Southeast regions. This could lead to temporary or, in the event of severe damage, permanent closure of one of our financial centers. Physical climate risks in the U.S. are compounded by aging infrastructure, critical infrastructure dependencies, expanding urban areas in tornado zones, coastal population expansion and a lack of associated forward investment as highlighted in a March 2014 report by National Climate Assessment. Our U.S. operations experienced 63 Natural Disaster events related to hurricanes, tropical storms, flooding, heavy snow and earthquakes in 2017. Our Asia Pacific and Latin America operations are also vulnerable to climate change impacts. There were 14 Natural Disaster events (tropical storms, typhoons and flooding) in Asia Pacific and 8 Natural Disaster events (earthquakes and heavy rains) in Latin America in 2017. Climate change may contribute to less predictability around the types, timing and location of severe weather events, and we account for this in our business continuity planning.
Water risks are considered as part of business continuity planning and uses threshold criteria established by that program. In the reporting year, no significant water risks have been identified. We continue to monitor water risk through regular activities performed by BD's Office of Global Sustainability. Any change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure that would prompt disclosure in other company filings (ex. 10-K) would be considered substantive for the purposes of CDP disclosures. This applies to both supply chain and direct operations.
An impact that would require explanation to all stakeholders involved. We haven't yet identified any risks that we believe could result in that type of impact.
Bemis considers all aspects of economic, social and environmental factors in assessing impacts to its business. One example of what Bemis would consider to be substantive is if production at any one of Bemis' 50+ global manufacturing facilities were to be shut down as the result of a water related issue.
Question not applicable
Specific to water-related risks, a substantive financial impact is any direct operations or supply chain issue that affects our profitability or financial position by more than one million USD.
A substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risks is defined as an unplanned disruption of the potable water supply and/or degradation of water quality for 1 hour or longer, which may be substantial enough to warrant shutting down portions/all of our manufacturing processes. As our manufacturing process is highly regimented, delays at any stage due to water shortage has the potential to require the entire batch to be discarded for quality and safety concerns. Additionally, some of our suppliers face similar constraints and substantial shutdowns for them could impact our material supplies, thus restricting our operations.
Birla Carbon's production process has generally not changed over a number of years. Where technological innovations are available we have made process changes to ensure maximum water efficiency utilization. Through water retention and recycling programs and other conservation measures we do not anticipate substantive changes in our water risks unless there is some significant unforeseen circumstance in a specific geographic location where a water resource might become unavailable or substantially increased in cost. Poor water quality and potential flooding is possible in some of our locations and we have integrated those risks into our Enterprise Risk Management approach.
Water recycled and reused data were not materialized to BizLink's industrial nature.BizLink's manufacturing process is mainly in dry mix. It does not operate any water intensive process, and the major water demand is for plant facility operations (e.g. air conditioners, compressors etc) and employees' daily use.

Effective risk management allows Bristol-Myers Squibb to achieve our business objectives, generate value for our stakeholders and provide the highest quality biopharmaceutical products. We follow an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process that encompasses our entire company to identify, assess, prioritize and address major risks on an ongoing basis. Risk is defined as the potential for loss caused by an event (or series of events) that can adversely affect the achievement of BMS's objectives. ERM addresses the full spectrum of risks: market/environmental, compliance, legal, strategic, financial/operational and reputational. Our approach is a systematic and disciplined set of policies, processes and practices, as well as a structure that enables ongoing identification, assessment, and prioritization of the major risks associated with our key business objectives. Our approach includes developing, implementing and monitoring risk mitigation strategies in addition to reporting significant financial risks with probabilities to our management team and Board of Directors. The Senior Management Team receives a quarterly report on enterprise risks. Climate change to date has not been elevated to the Senior Management team as a specific risk, though certain climate-related risks have been. Our Audit Committee periodically discusses with management company policies and guidelines regarding risk assessment and management, as well as major financial risk exposures and steps they have taken to monitor and control them.Substantive strategic impacts are considered risks or opportunities, which may have a significant impact on BMS and the potential for jeopardizing or restricting BMS's manufacturing or distribution of products that have a moderate to very high likelihood of occurring. All risks and opportunities disclosed meet the criteria for a substantive strategic impact but do not necessarily meet the criteria for a substantive financial risk.
Brown-Forman evaluates many variables in determining substantive change of our business and operations. One such variable is the overall availability of water for use in our direct operations. Globally, our company faces some direct risk associated with water scarcity because of the location of our operations and the requirements for water in our production processes and finished products. This risk stems from constraints on the available quantity, quality, and cost of water supplies across our enterprise but especially from a minority of our operations located in certain sensitive areas.Furthermore, a number of our key ingredients are agricultural based and are also dependent upon the availability of water. Any change in water dynamics, including water stress or even flooding, could cause supply disruptions or alterations in our supplier arrangements. This would result in cost increases for Brown-Forman. Also within our supply chain, we utilize co-packers for final completion of products. These facilities, while outside our operational control, rely upon abundant amounts of high quality water to carry out their services. Any disruption to their operations could impact the production and delivery of products.Weather, the effects of climate change, diseases, and other agricultural uncertainties that affect the mortality, health, yield, quality, or price of the various raw materials used in our products also present risks for our business, including in some cases potential impairment in the recorded value of our inventory. Changes in weather patterns or intensity can substantively disrupt our supply chain as well, which may affect production operations, insurance costs and coverage, as well as the timely delivery of our products to customers.Water is one of the major components of our products, so the quality and quantity of available water is important to our ability to operate our business. If droughts become more common or severe, or if our water supply were interrupted for other reasons, high-quality water could become scarce in some key production regions for our products, including Tennessee, Kentucky, California, Canada, and Mexico.
While Bunge has not defined a numerical threshold for what constitutes a substantive risk related to water, material impacts to the company's financial results may stem from three types of risk:  Our sugar production depends on the volume and sucrose content of the sugarcane that is supplied to us by third-party growers . Both sugarcane crop yields and sucrose content depend significantly on weather conditions, such as rainfall and prevailing temperatures. As such, unfavorable weather conditions have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our sugar operations.  Adverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, reduce demand for our fertilizer products and negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us.  Severe adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or flooding, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries and other loss and damage to us. Our direct operations and supply chain also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services. A disruption in transportation services, as a result of weather conditions or otherwise, may also significantly adversely impact our operations.
Financial or strategic impacts to business in the following area: general global downturn; technological improvement that would reduce need for CMC products; loss of major customer; competitor develops superior products; loss of intelluctual property; supplier disruption; risks to foreign operations; unforeseenegative impact of any merger or acquisition; cybersecurity threats to critical information; limited expertise and focus outside of CMP consumables; loss or unable to retain employee talent.
A substantive change is defined by Caesars as any risk that may impose one or more of the following: 1) physical damage, 2) increased regulatory constraints, or 3) impacts to operations, services, and revenues. The following thresholds have been identified for each type of substantive change: 1) a repair or replacement costing Caesars more than $25k -- the threshold for management approval 2) any regulatory constraints that prohibit the use of our swimming pools or impact the availability of water to provide fully-functioning WASH services, 3) an interruption in utility service, or one day of lost revenue at any Caesars property. This definition is inclusive of indirect impacts to operations, services and revenue through the supply chain. If a reduction in supply impacts menus for more than 5 business days, this would be considered substantive. If suppliers and alternative suppliers increase the cost of their goods or services by more than 3%, this would be considered substantive. Any amount of negative media attention would be considered substantive, as negative media attention will negatively affect the Caesars brand. We assess sites and supply chain categories at risk every year and determine which of these thresholds maybe in peril according to the WRI aqueduct tool and each sites water use. Additionally, groups throughout the organization review each threshold on a regular basis as part of their responsibilities.
A substantive impact is one that would cause a disruption to our manufacturing process and/or cause significant financial impacts.

Celestica has defined adverse material impacts in terms of our operations for known or perceived risks. The operational impact would have to meet the requirements defined in our 20-F submissions at a corporate level.We have Business Continuity exercises where water issues are considered, such as flooding resulting in potable water issues. We also have scenarios whereby scarcity impacts are realized at a site operations level due to droughts or other local disruptions such as wildfires or water pollution. To date, disruptions have not had material or adverse impacts on our finance or strategy of our operations.
As of the date of this response and for the sole purpose of this questionnaire and for no other purpose, a substantive financial or strategic impact resulting from climate change refers to risks and opportunities that are considered direct and meaningful and are likely to result in monetary costs or savings to Celgene. Potential substantive changes to Celgene's business and operations from water risks (see complete list below) are related to those that can contribute to a change in our business operations and impact costs related to water resources (withdrawal and discharge) and meeting regulatory requirements. The costs related to water resources primarily includes the costs associated with water withdrawal and discharge within operations. Costs can also be associated with regulatory fines and levies if any are made against our company in the future. This definition for substantive change is only applied to Celgene's direct operations and more specifically for freshwater water availability, quality and quantity which are vital for operations and employee consumption. Another definition that relates to Celgene's supply chain has yet to be formulated and applied.
Cisco defines substantive change as either affecting publicly reported financial results, changes to existing enterprise risk assessment results requiring mitigating action, or impacting component or product availability to the extent customer shipments or schedule are impacted. Cisco defines a substantive financial impact as anything that creates a penny a share impact or greater; i.e. greater than $50M in net income, or more than $200M in revenue. This definition applies to both our direct operations and supply chain and is reviewed and updated on an annual basis as part of Cisco's broader enterprise risk management (ERM) process conducted by Cisco's internal audit organization.
Clorox uses a systematic process to evaluate risks. The process includes identifying risks, assessing exposures and quantifying the value at risk to the company. The evaluation considers level of potential impact, the overall vulnerability to an event based on the time and our capacity to react and adapt, and the likelihood of an occurrence. While severe regional weather events have the potential to disrupt our operations, or that of our customers and/or suppliers, we believe our dispersed supply chain affords us redundancy, which mitigates risk to our business from localized events. We believe the location of our facilities limit threats from rising ocean levels. Our global strategic sourcing function also has contingency plans in place to identify critical suppliers which may be impacted by extreme weather conditions with specific focus on areas of high water stress. Additionally, Clorox engages in engineering loss-prevention strategies aimed at reducing the risk of natural and accidental hazards and each location has backup power supply for critical functions. The company's manufacturing locations have comprehensive emergency response plans and most locations have business continuity plans. The company's headquarters also has an emergency response plan with trained floor wardens, established evacuation procedures and business continuity plans for critical functions. The Clorox Company is developing an enterprise wide framework and approach to prioritize local water risk issues and potential actions in all of the global regions in which we operate. In addition to understanding water-risk across our global operations, the use of tools allows us to identify water stressed areas and help direct our focus and resources to these geographies. This process includes screening all of our global locations using the Water Resource Institute's (WRI) Aqueduct tool.
Consumers Energy defines a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure for water risk as any change that would dramatically affect our operation reliability, costs or reputation. The definition applies to direct operations. Specific levels of change or numeric metrics of change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure for water are not established. Electricity markets are complex and based on many factors, including the relative cost of electricity within an established organization, often covering several states. The organization is approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to coordinate, control and monitor the use of the electric transmission system by utilities, generators and marketers. For the operations and facilities covered in this response, that organization is the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), Zone 7.
Definition of substantive financial/strategic impact: Our company evaluates matters on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business. As a U.S. public company, we always have in mind the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission's materiality standard, which does not have absolute dollar value or percentage thresholds. When evaluating particular matters, we would consider, among other factors, the size of the business units impacted; the size of the impact on those business units; whether the impact to the Company's business is continuing and whether the Company is able to offset such impact and the potential for shareholder or reputational impact. Colgate uses an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program to identify, assess, prioritize and manage physical risks. The ERM Committee is sponsored by the Chairman and CEO of the Company and includes representation from key internal business leaders. Risks are collectively identified across the organization and are classified within the Strategic, Financial, Operational, Information Technology, Legal & Compliance and Emerging Risk Categories. Each Risk Category is assigned an owner who is also a member of the ERM Committee and who is ultimately accountable for successfully managing the identified risk. The Natural Disaster ERM - addresses the physical risks associated with water and climate change that could disrupt our commercial and supply chain operations. For purposes of this survey, we used a screening criteria to identify sites meeting the CDP guidance for "substantive" as follows: 1) sites indicated as "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk per WRI Aqueduct, and 2) which are either considered strategic sites or those which account for >2% of global production volume. This threshold is evaluated annually, when the Aqueduct tool is used to evaluate water risk. The Global Sustainability and EHS group engages with local sites to evaluate the threshold based on both the Aqueduct tool and more short-term and local conditions and events.An example of substantive risks evaluated includes key supply disruption. Colgate has a formal process to identify critical suppliers (e.g. high volume suppliers, suppliers of critical materials, non-substitutable formulas). Every year we update our segmentation strategies where we classify materials and suppliers according to the criticality of the material segment as well as the market complexity and buyer power using a matrix tool. Selected agricultural materials that are impacted by change in precipitation extremes and droughts are considered in this process. Risk management plans including changes in source of supply and potential alternative formulations are in place.
Water is critical to plant operations. Loss of water would be a substantive impact on business.
Water-related risks are particularly relevant to the food industry, with a global supply chain intensely dependent on the availability of clean water to grow ingredients. Managing water risk â€” both at our own facilities and those embedded in our supply chain â€” is critical to Conagra Brands' long-term business success. To determine whether these water-related risks have potential to generate a substantive change in our business operations, revenue or expenditures, we've applied US Securities Exchange Commission materiality principles, considering both quantitative and qualitative impacts. The risk analysis factors in both the probability of the risk and estimated financial implications. For this purpose, material risks generating substantive change to our direct operations and supply chain would be changes affecting more than 5% of our revenue or assets. Examples of substantive risks include impacts that could threaten any of our brands through production shut-down or inability to obtain raw materials for our products. For instance, our Hunt'sÂ® tomato products rely on tomatoes sourced from California, where drought is a persistent risk. This brand generates approximately $450MM of our annual earnings.
A substantive financial or strategic impact on our business is any impact that would materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. These impacts include, but are not limited to, factors such as coal price, quality, or characteristics, the demand for our coal, the operation of our major mining equipment with limited downtime, and our ability to obtain permits and licenses to conduct mining activities. The most significant risk factors to our business are outlined in detail in CONSOL Energy's Form 10-K, available at www.sec.gov and www.consolenergy.com.
In defining substantive change to our business, operations, revenues or expenditures from water risk, Constellation considers both the magnitude of the potential loss, and the likelihood of the risk. For the purposes of this report, we define substantive change as the potential loss of 5% or more of our global production volume as well as the potential loss of 5% in each segment of our business (beer vs. wine & spirits). This percentage may vary slightly year to year. This metric includes only our direct Operations and not our supply chain. For example, a winery that accounts for 7% of our total global production volume would be considered to have a substantive impact as disruption to production or supply may have a material effect on our business.
If our water supply is affected negatively, this will impact our ability to make product and thereby meet our customer expectations.
All risks, including water-related risks are identified at the operating area level. Many of the risks identified are common throughout our operations. CPG is working to mitigate risks to our business by utilizing alternative water sources to reduce freshwater use. For example, CPG was able to secure a contract with the Town of Roosevelt to utilize industrial water which reduces our need for freshwater in the completions operations. Another example of this is in SESK, we are able to utilize industrial water from a waste facility, therefore reducing freshwater use in the completions operations. Substantive risks are generally defined as having a financial impact greater than $250 million CAD, though can be lower if the risk imposes significant harm to the environment, people or our company's reputation.
Cummins uses a multi-pronged approach to evaluate risks and opportunities and determining if they are substantive to our business. Cummins Business Continuity Planning function prioritizes and addresses key risks of which water related issues are one component. Cummins developed a cause and effect (C&E) matrix to prioritize sites combining multiple factors including: 1) site's self-assessment of water risk from a survey on source water sustainability, quality, discharge, regulatory, and cost considerations addressing both current and future conditions, 2) site size and complexity, 3) the presence or absence of water supply assessments, 4) and watershed-specific water stress indicators. For water stress indicators, Cummins worked with an external consultant to develop a composite picture of current and future water stress by combining data from WRI Aqueduct Tool, WBCSD Global Water Tool, and consultant expertise in the countries/regions where we operate. Portions of this data extend to a 2025 planning horizon. Scoring and weighting factors were applied to each of the 4 components of the C&E matrix and an â€˜at risk' threshold was defined as any sites scoring 150 or above in total composite score. Based on this, Cummins conducted detailed watershed assessments at each of the 3 locations scoring above the 150 â€˜at risk' threshold, recently we added two more sites. BFCEC due to its growth that raised the risk scoring and CBL due to specific water issues arising in the area. In addition to the watershed assessments over 24 site level audits have been conducted to further validate conditions at prioritized sites. These audits and assessments identified specific areas for water management improvements including conservation, risk management, and community/watershed engagement opportunities. Facility data and conditions are reviewed annually and may alter the priority sites from year to year. CMI identified 264 critical suppliers. The water risk using the Maplecroft tool has been analyzed for each of these suppliers. Select suppliers will be required to submit a risk mitigation plan as a results of their scores. In addition to the six sigma project and the supplier engagement, CMI has developed a risk scoring tool that utilizes risk and quality data available from Maplecroft. This new tool will help assign a risk factor for each site that can be used when evaluating investment opportunities. It will also help in the evaluation of a supplier and new facility locations.
We do not have a specific threshold used to determine substantive financial or strategic impact on the business. Impacts are considered and evaluated on a case by case basis. Typically, impacts deemed substantive have a financial impact in range of hundreds of millions of dollars.
No expressed monetary figure but generally the inability to access water necessary to clean/produce parts and provide a sanitary work environment are risks that should be accounted for in an assessment. As stated earlier, the water-related assessment has not been conducted at this point.
As stated in our 2017 fiscal year 10-K, John Deere's business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment. This may include water related items such as timing and quantity of rainfall, excessive rain, flooding and drought conditions. Due to the variability and uncertainty of weather conditions affecting our customers globally, for the purposes of this CDP response we are focused on our direct operations, and the water risk attributes of water scarcity and volume. Usingthe WRI Aqueduct Tool, we define substantive change from water risk in terms of water scarcity and volume for those manufacturing and distribution operations currently sited in regions defined as having a baseline water stress of extremely high stress, high stress, and medium to high stress considering a projected change over 20 years. We also determine if these sites are considered strategic meaning they account for >2% of global production volume. If both criteria are met, then these sites could pose a substantive change in our business, operations or revenue.
At Dell the substantive financial and strategic thresholds vary depending on the business unit, geographic region and the likelihood and magnitude of the impact of a potential risk. In that sense something that may be highly important at a functional, regional or local level may not be so at the enterprise level. To ensure risk management consistency, we created a common risk taxonomy and risk analysis tools to assist the business with risk prioritization. The standardized toolset allows the business to define, analyze, organize and prioritize risks according to both enterprise and individual business risk tolerances. Risks are linked in a hierarchy that represents the relationships between the largest risk categories (Enterprise Risks) and the more granular risks. This hierarchy is used to normalize risks across the enterprise and obtain a consolidated view of the most critical risks in the company. By engaging our risk practitioners on a common risk framework, we are able to leverage resources more efficiently, avoid duplicating processes and tools, encourage more open discussion, highlight interdependencies, prioritize mitigation investment, balance mitigation against crisis management, and provide increased visibility into risk mitigation. Since our dependence on water is relatively low, and most of Dell Technologies' water withdrawals come from municipal water sources, we have historically prioritized efforts around water use in water stressed regions. Our assessments indicate that Dell's water risk may be associated with supply chain disruption caused by climate change and other water hazards. These disruptions may affect product or component availability and increase operations costs as alternative suppliers are utilized at greater costs, all of which may result in a financial impact for the organization in the future.
Lack of water supply can negatively impact our ability to complete wells leading to delays in production. Lack of water take-away capacity can result in wells being shut in, reducing production volumes.
We publish material information about the Company's activities, including water-related risks, in official filings. For our definition of ''substantive financial or strategic impactâ€, we define such impact to be any change in the determination of investors in buying, holding, and selling Dominion Energy securities. As such, the metric of ''substantive changeâ€ is simply whether or not a reasonable investor would attach importance to the change in question. We set this threshold very tightly; any change to which a reasonable investor would attach importance when considering Dominion securities counts as an issue with the potential to cause a substantive strategic impact. This is applicable primarily to our direct operations, though it can occasionally apply to our indirect operations as issues that affect Dominion Energy service areas. For example, heat waves can cause a spike in electricity demand. As an example of a considered water-related substantive impact, our 2017 10-K Annual Report identifies storms, earthquakes, and floods as having the potential to disrupt operation of company facilities, negatively impacting our direct operations and potentially being of importance to a reasonable investor. Dominion Energy considers information to be ''materialâ€ based on thresholds defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the companies' financial reporting.
The majority of our operations and supply chain takes place in Michigan, which has an abundant fresh water supply. Although the risks to our company are low at this time, the risks are expected to increase in the future (e.g. as regulations continue to change and challenge our industry). An example of a substantive change would be legislation or a physical change in supply that would reduce our ability to withdraw the amount of water needed to produce adequate amount of electricity for our customers
Duke Energy uses a scoring criteria to assess and rank risks. "Substantive" is interpreted as a "(4) Severe" rating per Duke Energy risk scoring criteria for Enterprise and EHS Risk Levels, which range from (1) least severe to (5) most severe.At the Enterprise Level, a scoring of (4) Severe corresponds to:- A cost impact greater than or equal to $50 million- Enterprise short term incentive (STI) measures driven below minimum performance- Failure to achieve business unit (BU) strategic initiatives- Goverment Council or Excutive Vice President (EVP) intervention necessary- Negative Regulatory Outcomes with significant fines or penalties- Major customer/investor inquiries- Regulatory outcomes or policy changes expected, litigation possible-Active protests/picketing- National news exposure (major storm failure, major impact on the environment) At the EHS Department Level a scoring of (4) Severe corresponds to:- Harm to Environment, whcih is defined as: o Release requires remediation of environmental media greater than 3 years;o Long term impacts to plants/animals/water bodies;â€¢ Compliance/Regulatory Impact, which is defined as:o Agency action or exceedance that results in impacts or significant limits on operation(s); o Negative regulatory outcomes including fines or penalties for reportable environmental event(s)â€¢ Reputation, or Major customer/investor backlash, or Complaints to regulators.
Question not applicable
What constitutes ''materialâ€ must be judged from the viewpoint of a reasonably prudent investor making a decision to buy, hold or sell stock. An item is considered material if, in the light of surrounding circumstances, the magnitude of the item is such that it is probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the item. DuPont does not believe it has any material water risks.In item 1A of the DuPont annual 10-K report, we do identify unpredictable seasonal and weather factors as a risk that could impact sales and earnings from the company's Agriculture segment. Weather factors such as droughts or changing precipitation patterns could impact the agriculture sector in several ways. Please refer to Item 1A of the DuPont annual 10-K report for a discussion of risk factors.
Eastman defines substantive change as one that would be â€˜material' information as defined by applicable law and thus requiring public disclosure to investors. This applies to both direct operations and to the supply chain.
Substantive change to the business, operations, revenue, or expenditure from water risk is defined as implications from water cost or availability that negatively affect operations, i.e. losing license to operate, inability to continue operations, significant increases in water bills, etc.
When assessing water risk in our direct manufacturing operations, we measure the impact on our total production volume to determine substantive impacts on the business. We define risks that have a â€˜substantive financial or strategic impact' as having a >10% impact on Ecolab's total production in its direct manufacturing operations. When assessing water risk in supply chain and more broadly across our corporate level Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, we define risks that have a â€˜substantive financial or strategic impact' as having an impact of greater than 5% of operating income, either as an isolated event or combination of factors that may impact our corporate strategy and business continuity. This assessment and its criteria are reviewed annually and incorporated into our annual business risk assessment and reporting processes. Substantive impacts that we consider in this assessment include, for example, the current baseline water stress as scored by the WRI Aqueduct tool; the future predicted change in baseline water stress using the IEA 450 climate scenario to 2030 and the business-as-usual IPCC RCP8.5 climate scenario to 2030. In 2017, we identified 4 facilities, representing 25% of our total water withdrawal and 9% of our production volume, that operate in river basins with current and/or future defined water stress and may be affected by Ecolab's water withdrawal; however no single, nor combination of sites exceed our production impact threshold of 10%, therefore we believe we do not have inherent water risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business operations. With regards to managing risks identified at these four sites, two of our sites that exceeded criteria thresholds have completed Alliance for Water Stewardship Certification and another has just launched a water recycling project that will reduce consumption by more than 20%. Related, we did not identify any substantive risks in our supply chain that exceed our threshold.
Substantive financial or strategic impact on our business operations is defined, prioritized and managed through our enterprise risk management strategy. Due to confidentiality and public reporting restrictions, we are unable to publicly disclose our processes or calculated risks associated with water disruption potentials.
We define a substantive change as any water-related impact that results in material (+/- 5%) reduction or stoppage in production and/or (future) revenue at our sites, or a material financial cost to the Company relating to water sourcing, treatment and management.
In our direct operations and supply chains, bulk active ingredient manufacturing sites use the largest amounts of water followed by final dosage finishing sites. Packaging sites require very little water and present less risk to the organization. In our Global Supply Chain, we already take into account manufacturing issues that could shut down bulk active ingredient sites for 6 to 10 months, drug final dosage finishing manufacturing for 2 to 3 months and packaging for 1 to 2 months. We use inventory management practices as a primary risk mitigation strategy. An extreme weather stress event (i.e. a drought that provided a moratorium on water use for many months) would have to extend beyond these periods for there to be a substantial impact on Lilly. Our Global Supply Chain also works with our Treasury area and an external consultant to develop scenarios of "catastrophic" events (i.e. a manufacturing site being "destroyed "). We determined that a drought/water disruption scenario would have to extend for a long time (i.e. several years) to cause a substantive change to our business. Given these conditions and our product mix, we made a determination that extended periods of drought should not significantly impact our business. Costs associated with these analyses are embedded in operations budgets and are not disclosed.Lilly's Global Supply Chain and ERM procedures have defined business risk paramaters and financial thresholds built into their processes to evaluate the estimates of likelihood, potential impacts and/or relevance for stakeholders of business impacts. One example of substantive impact analyis that was considered was placement of a parenteral product (i.e. injectables) plant in a water stressed area. Simple mitigation plans were implemented as a result.

Enbridge is acutely aware that public support for our business depends on our ability to safely, reliably and affordably deliver the energy people need and want while protecting the environment. Without this public support delivering on our capital growth plans becomes increasingly challenging. These core societal expectations are not negotiable. Over the last six years, we have mounted what we believe to be one of the most comprehensive approaches in our industry to deploying new management systems and technologies for reducing risk and protecting the safety of our employees and contractors, as well as the communities and environments in which we operate. At the heart of our approach is a commitment to maintaining the fitness and reliability of our systems, and programs for leak prevention and emergency response.Our key priority is to achieve zero spills or leaks of any of the liquids we transport. Resources are directed toward preventing off-property spills and leaks because they can impact the environment, damage property, and impact public and worker safety. This includes watercourses and environmentally sensitive areas. We address these key priorities by taking the following actions:Design and Construction - We build safety and reliability into our infrastructure long before we construct and operate any of our projects. We carefully select our pipeline routes and line locations, and follow strict standards for engineering and design. Special design considerations are made for areas such as road, river and creek crossings and for high-consequence areas where the public may be affected. In Canada, a Pipeline Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) is submitted to the National Energy Board (NEB) as part of the Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA). The EPP is designed to compile all the environmental protection measure to be implemented during construction and contingency plans related to environmental matters during construction. The measures and contingency plans in the EPP were developed to address the potential effects identified in the ESA for the respective project and includes the potential effects identified by federal and provincial government agencies, and stakeholders (i.e. landowners). The EPP includes sections dedicated to both Watercourse and Wetland crossings which includes details regarding the approach to regulatory approvals and permitting. The following is a link to the EPP for Enbridge's Line 3 Replacement Project which serves as an example of our approach (https://apps.neb-one.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/2545319).Monitoring and Prevention - Once our pipelines are running, we continually monitor and operate them to protect their reliability. This work involves recognizing conditions that have been known to cause failures in the past and carefully analyzing failures from our peers, and working to minimize the risks.Leak and Damage Prevention - Pipeline fitness, safety and reliability also involve taking a comprehensive approach to leak detection. We devote resources, both people and automated system, on a continuous, basis to ensuring that we control and mitigate any potential problem, should it arise. We monitor our pipelines for possible leaks and damages using a number of methods, each with a different focus and each using different technology, resources and timing.The Enbridge Liquid Pipelines business unit defines risk to water as having a substantive change to our business using a standardized risk matrix to evaluate risk consequence and likelihood. Where Enbridge's operations could impact water the risk consequence is considered to be Major to Critical; however the likelihood of events occurring at these locations is kept Low through multiple control and mitigation measures. The risk consequence of an impact to water range defined as Major to Critical ranges in financial value from >$1M to â‰¤$1B, impacts an area ranging in size from 0.1 ha to 1 km2 and impacts a waterbody ranging from a wetland to a lake or fast moving creek or river. Ecological restoration activities could range from 1 to 10 years in duration.Project risks around water which could contribute to substantive changes to business are assessed through the use of a Risk Screening Tool. Risk levels are classified as Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High with a set of detailed impact criteria associated to each level. Risks associated with leaks and spills to water from a stakeholder materiality perspective are considered to have a Very High Impact and Very High Probability. The Impact Criteria include costs in excess of $50M, a delay in milestone achievements (i.e. project completion) of greater than 6 months and a service disruption of greater than 1 month for our customers.A risk consequence of Major to Critical would be considered to be a substantive change to our business.
Substantive impact is defined as impacting the economic viability of an operational area or facility, triggering a new evaluation of whether the facility is a net asset or liability. For instance, if the cash flows no longer exceed the anticipated abandonment or the cumulative positives are less than the book value (up front capital), there may be net loss.Metrics used to determine substantive impact include: proved reserves, annual production, net income, cashflow, fixed and variable operational costs, finding and development costs and capital efficiencies. These metrics are reviewed annually. Due to variable economic parameters, specific thresholds used to determine if substantive vary by operational area.Enerplus defines substantive applicable to direct operation only.One example of substantive impact considered would be the lack of economically viable fresh water for hydraulic operations. If regional water shortages led to surface water withdrawal curtailments, water may have to be purchased from alternative vendors at additional costs. At some tipping point the economics of the well might no longer make business sense. These evaluations are done throughout the project life cycle.
A substantive change from water risk would include impacts to operations or expenditures due to water availability or cost that would drive financial performance results for the year significantly outside the forecasted ranges (i.e. guidance).
For water resources, substantive change would be one that significantly impacts an operating asset located in an area of water risk as identified by the WRI Aqueduct global water risk tool, such as a cooling water system retrofit mandated by a permitting authority, or the potential for shareholder or customer concern or a combination resulting in a larger impact. The basis for expressing the percentage of operation affected is based on plants identified using WRI Aqueduct global water risk mapping plus our own plant specific information. The calculation is: total net generation MWh or the facilities located in water stress regions divided by the total net generation MWh produced by the generation facilities over which Exelon has operational control. This percentage does not include operations related to the marketing and distribution of energy or natural gas, which have less significant water uses. Exelon Corporation compiles an enterprise-wide inventory of water withdrawals and associated discharges annually. Exelon uses the WRI Aqueduct global water risk tool to screen for potential geographic water scarcity that may affect our operations or our supply chain . All facilities identified in the screening process as being potentially located in water scarce areas are further evaluated using internal company knowledge and regional basin management information to confirm the model output. The WRI Aqueduct global water risk tool uses twelve global maps grouped into physical, quantity, quality , regulatory and reputational risk. The seven physical quantity risks include: baseline water stress; inter-annual variability; seasonal variability; floods; drought severity; upstream storage and groundwater. Physical water quality risks include return flow ration and upstream protected land. The three regulatory and reputational risks include media coverage, access to water and threatened amphibians. Overall water risk assessment identifies areas with higher exposure to these water-related risks and is an aggregated measure. In the past, Exelon used the UNEP water stress map which shows that Exelon has no operations in water stressed areas based on the UNEP definition (less than 1700 cubic meters per person per year). WRI's new Aqueduct assessment tool is more relevant in its definition of water stress, and therefore, identifies some areas where we operate that are subject to water stress as defined in the multivariate analyses in the WRI Aqueduct tool.
First Solar has an enterprise risk mangement process that includes identifying entity-level risks and opportunities via a forward-looking view (a three-year horizon). Risks are assessed based on likelihood and impact and residual risk, (i.e. remaining risk after action and control activities) is addressed to further mitigate risk. For the 2018 annual assessment, our definition for a substantive financial impact is a direct loss or opportunity cost of more than $50 million. Substantive strategic impacts on our business include a major impact on our strategy, major financial overrun, and/or failure to meet our key strategic goals. Our definition of substantive risk applies to both direct operations and our supply chain.Natural disasters such as floods and disruptions to our utility water supply that affect a plant's ability to produce and perform process development activities are water risks that could generate substantive change to our business. These risks would likely result in us losing some production for a while, until we are able to bring the affected buildings back to production. In this case, substantive risk is defined in terms of its impact on our overall production. Of the 2.3 GW produced in 2017, our manufacturing facility in Ohio represented approximately 9% while operations in Malaysia represent 91%.In addition to manufacturing thin film solar photovoltaic modules, First Solar also develops, finances, engineers, constructs, and operates some of the world's largest PV power plants. The successful development and construction of solar energy generation facilities is contingent upon, securing necessary water rights for project construction and operation, among other things. Water shortages in regions where we develop and construct PV projects could adversely affect, delay and/or render the successful completion of a particular project infeasible.
Water is essential to FirstEnergy's ability to generate electricity, as many of our plants use water for steam production and plant cooling purposes. Costs could be incurred in the future due to more stringent water regulations and/or availability of sufficient quantity of freshwater.
The risk to our operations is strictly due to interruption or curtailment, as opposed to water costs. Although most of our business processes do not consume large quantities of water, we do require a sufficient supply in order to run our business. If our operations were to experience an event (in the form of an interruption) where we could not receive ample water, we could face significant limits to production. The more probable impacts would be to ancillary operations, e.g. dormitories housing our workers, as opposed to production. There are also potential impacts in our supply chain as some of those operations are more water intensive. During our risk assessment, we concluded that our facilities that consume the largest percentage of water are not in water stressed regions. As part of our risk analysis we included locations that are potentially exposed to high or extremely high risk to drought, flood or water stress. Then we consider the ones from such list that represent more than 1% of our global sales.
Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials due to water risk may have an adverse impact on profitability in Flowers' direct operations.
We use an industry definition.
At a company level, FMC's Risk Council, Risk Management and Sustainability Group interact with FMC locations and functions on many issues, which can include climate change risks and opportunities. The Risk Council includes FMC executive leadership and is responsible for ensuring good risk governance, defining strategic risks, and monitoring risk assessment processes in strategic planning, business planning, capital planning and M&A. The Sustainability Group conducts an annual materiality assessment that quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes material issuesThey conduct interviews with employees with a deep understanding of our business from Sustainability, Government Affairs, Internal Audit, Investor Relations, Communications, Finance, Legal, Operations, Safety and Environment/Remediation. They also conduct a survey asking internal and external stakeholders to rank material issues based on each issue's perceived impact on and importance to FMC. The survey includes 62 issues that fell into 5 categories: Operations, Workplace, Environment, Marketplace, and Community. Stakeholders scored each issue on 5 factors: financial impact and risk, regulatory and policy drivers, peer-based norms, stakeholder concerns and societal trends and opportunities for innovation. An issue that scores high on internal and external surveys is considered a material issue of high importance; high scoring issues are prioritized and considered for more research and/or stakeholder alignment. These surveys and stakeholder interviews inform our sustainability priorities, strategies, and reporting. The most material issues are reported in FMC's sustainability report. Among the high material issues reported in the 2017 Sustainability Report are climate change, energy use, water use and waste. The 2017 survey had 51 respondents, representing non-government organizations, customers, suppliers, foundations, trade associations and employees. The most material issues were reported to FMC's executive leadership team, Sustainability Steering Committee, Board Sustainability Team and in our Sustainability Report.The Sustainability Group reports on the company's energy consumption, GHG emissions, water use and waste generation data. FMC obtained third-party assurance on its 2015, 2016 and 2017 data. FMC's sites collect and report this data to the Sustainability Group, ensuring FMC is able to measure its environmental impact. The Sustainability Group conducts water risk assessments, energy audits and social responsibility audits at FMC facilities and results are applied at other sites as needed.On an asset level, Risk Management conducts an annual risk assessment for our manufacturing sites and physical assets. It has a review process for potential natural catastrophes and possible sources of risks, which are generally disclosed in our 10-K. The Risk Management process has an Enterprise Risk Assessment component, which includes interviews of FMC's top leaders annually. FMC assesses risks using impact and likelihood definitions as previously defined by the Risk Council to arrive at ''enterpriseâ€ level risks, those estimated to have a financial impact of $50 million or more of EBIT. Based on this initial assessment, a preliminary report is presented to the Risk Council. After incorporating the Risk Council's input, enterprise risks are validated and the top risks prioritized in facilitated workshops with risk owners. These facilitated workshops use voting technology to find greater consensus on key risk impact, likelihood and owner. The final results are reported to the executive committee and Board each year.
Our analysis of Ford operations shows that some of our facilities are located in regions where water supplies are already scarce. Global climate change also has the potential to further impact the quality and availability of water. We cannot be certain that we will always have access to water of the quantity and quality that our operations require. Our water strategy puts primary emphasis on our plants located in areas of water scarcity.Ford is committed to conserving water and using it responsibly. We will address water challenges internally within our own operations and externally in communities where we operate and throughout our supply chain. We have committed to measureable actions to support our global water strategy.In deciding which facilities and which basins concern Ford, aggregate scores from the Global Water Tool (subwatershed level) were used alongside internal knowledge of specific facilities and local watersheds. If a facility had a high risk or projected risk by the tools, it was listed. The operating facilities listed as ''substantiveâ€ had to have a high stress or risk and have a production or support production of greater than 1% of global relevant production (vehicle, engines, or transmissions). This definition of risk applies to Ford's direct operations. For example, losing production at a Ford assembly plant, which would amount to greater than 1% of total vehicle production, would be a substantive financial and strategic impact on our business.For supply chain, we utilized the following methodology to determine water risks that could generate a potential impact to our supply chain. Suppliers are selected to participate in the CDP Supply Chain water questionnaire based on a combination of factors including those that supply water-intensive commodities, those with operations in water-stressed areas (as determined using the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and Maplecroft tool) and their business relationship with Ford. We repeat our assessment of selected suppliers in light of developments in these three areas on an annual basis. For this outreach, the threshold for "substantive" is if a supplier supplying greater than 0.1% of production spend has sites located in water stressed areas. In some cases, suppliers who fall below this general threshold may be selected for participation due to other potential risk factors. The ongoing data obtained through the CDP surveys has helped us identify ''hotspotsâ€ for GHG emissions and water use. These suppliers have been targeted to participate in the Partnership for a Cleaner Environment (PACE) program whereby Ford will share leading practices for water use reductions with these suppliers, work with them to set reduction targets and reduce our collective environmental footprint.
Water risks are not assessed at this time.
A substantial risk could include, but may not be limited to, a curtailment or disruption of mine production, prevention of mine expansion opportunities, increased capital expenditure and operational maintenance costs associated with development of alternate and renewable water supplies, or increased capital expenditures and increased operating costs associated with water quality programs and technologies.Please see additional information in the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K.
Question not applicable
Substantive changes from water risks in our supply chain include those that could have a substantial impact on our business results incurring financial impacts which would be demonstrated in our financial filings such as Form 10-K or reputation with key stakeholders. These could include disruptions in our ability to source products or increases in product costs due to risks such as water scarcity, quality, pollution, drought or flooding. Risk of water availability to our suppliers' operations could lead to significant delays in production as our suppliers' capacity is diminished, which could lead to lost sales for our business. Water-related impacts such as drought, storms or extensive flooding in agricultural regions where cotton is produced could substantially increase the cost of cotton, which is an essential raw material for our product, affecting our costs of goods sold. Similarly, water-related impacts in regions where we manufacture may cause disruption or delay in our supply chain. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors' manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers' perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.They could also include reputation risks due to the impact of water-related risks that affect the well-being of the people who make our clothes or local communities. These reputation risks could adversely affect consumers' perceptions of our brands and lead to lower demand for our products.
Question not applicable
We perform an ongoing assessment of a variety of risks impacting our business. As part of that process, we consider potential financial impacts over the near term and longer time horizons. Our risk analysis includes potential costs associated with increased or volatile commodity prices (and other related costs) resulting from water risks as well as risk of water supply restrictions to facilities. Risks are evaluated based on the total financial impact relative to the size of our business and the likelihood of those risks coming to fruition. For the purposes of this disclosure, substantive means an impact that would result in a significant impact to a key ingredient or key operation. Substantive risk for General Mills are risks that has high likelihood of occurrence and would impact greater than $50 millionto General Mills. A key ingredient is an ingredient that is geographically restricted such as almonds, dates or milk (due to the transportation cost) or its availability is controlled by local government and a key operation is one where we manufacturer a significant volume or sole source production of a product.A prime example of a supply chain key ingredient is almonds. With ~80% of the world's almond supply coming from California, a water related disruption to the almond supply in that state is a risk to some of General Mills' products.Risks are considered as part of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. The ERM identifies risks to the company and its facilities (assets), plans mitigation activity, and provide reasonable assurance that the risks are being managed. The ERM covers the entire company including facilities, upstream (sourcing) and downstream (distribution and warehousing) supply chain, etc. Risks at the company level; The ERM Committee manages the process and promotes alignment between company's risk and Management's risk appetite. The process:1. Risks Identification â€“ input from senior leaders, business units, functions and facilities leveraging external perspectives and emerging risks2. Risk Response and Control Activity â€“ Business unit identification of risk mitigation activities. A key input to this process is our Global Sustainability and our Safety and Environment functions3. Reassessment â€“ ERM Committee reassess risk level and mitigation effectiveness4. Annual Risk Report â€“ report to Senior Management and Board of DirectorsOur risk analysis includes potential costs associated with increased or volatile commodity prices (and other related costs) resulting from water risks as well as risk of water supply restrictions to facilities. Risk is assessed using a three by three matrix using Low, Medium, High on the likelihood of the risk occurring over 10 years versus the impact of that risk in millions of dollars. The ERM Committee manages the process and promotes alignment between company's risk and Management's risk appetite.
For direct operations and in our supply chain, GM defines substantive change in their business to be when more than 20% of operating production could be impacted at a company level for ongoing operations (for example an impact to 2 million vehicles of production). The Chief Risk Officer of GM is our Chairman and CEO. The Risk Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing GM's management of enterprise-level risks. Additionally, during new construction planning, the site planning team considers substantive risk as inadequate water supply for direct operations to meet 100% design operating production volumes.While the risks related to water at any individual GM facility are not substantive to GM in total, our operations in Mexico at San Luis Potosi were identified as substantive during the site planning phase and corrective actions to mitigate the water risks were implemented prior to production start. This includes additional spending for water reuse to meet production water supply requirements and the installation of Zero Liquid Discharge to minimize the impact to GM's operations and the local community.For supply chain operations, GM has performed life cycle analysis of water consumption of all suppliers and used water consumption information to identify the top 100 suppliers by overall risk using WRI Aqueduct model. Although 4% showed high risk, our experience with current operations show that there is not a substantive risk due to water for these suppliers.To engage these high risk and other strategic suppliers, GM joined CDP Water supply chain in 2014, continuing in 2017-8 and invited all of our strategic suppliers, including the high consumption suppliers to engage them in water security management.
If a risk could result in an impact greater than $33 million, depending on the probability assigned, that is the threshold value to be ranked as a High or Extreme category risk at the enterprise level. The basis for this is 2.5% of the company's annual cash flow.
In the context of the CDP Water response, Goodyear interprets a substantive change as the inability to manufacture tires in accordance with Goodyear's long-term strategy. This relates to direct operations and the measure would include the prevention of growing production by one tire or more, meaning any growth prevented directly by water-related issues. This metric is reviewed annually as a part of the global water risk assessment and is included in the overall water risk assessment plans.
GPI defines substantive strategic impact on the business as any effect that would significantly disrupt, restrict, jeopardize or prohibit direct manufacturing operations to continue across a group of or an individual mill or other manufacturing facility responsible for a majority of the organization's materials used at the conversion facilities as part of the supply chain. Indicators used to identify substantive change within GPI's direct operations may include the existence of insurance claims, litigative action, damages or disruptions to operations and production that are material in nature. An example of substantive impact considered would include potential damages as a result of flooding risks that may impair the ability of GPI to operate our mills at a normal capacity.
Question not applicable
Substantive risks to our direct operations are those that impact our ability to successfully deliver products to our customers in a timely manner. Risks are prioritized based on severity and probability, allowing us to focus on those risks that are the most likely to have a considerable financial impact.Our production facilities monitor and report potential site-specific risks monthly, and company-wide assessments are completed annually. Each assessment follows a standard methodology that evaluates the frequency and severity of potential risks, including several water-related risks, such as sea level rise and flooding. These scores are ranked based on a scale of likelihood and severity, and the top potential risks make up management priorities for the upcoming period. Additionally, we work closely with our customers to understand their concerns and meet all risk mitigation requirements, including coordinating customer audits of relevant facilities.Unexpected events, including natural disasters and severe weather events at our facilities or those of our suppliers could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey and the resulting flooding disrupted our operations in Houston, TX, and we were required to shut down that facility for three days, at a total estimated cost of $50,000.
Substantive change is defined as change that could materially impact revenues or costs. For example by curtailing operations such as hydraulic fracturing, or by restricting access to a crucial supply chain input such as fresh water or guar.
HanesBrands defines substantive impact from water risk as a condition or set of conditions related to water supply which would result in the curtailment of production at one of its primary operating facilities, to the extent that the company's ability to fulfill customer orders is materially impacted.

What is your company's definition of substantive financial or strategic impact? HPE's ERM process, which is based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) enterprise risk management framework, defines substantive financial impact as 5% of operating profits. Any risk to the company's operations that exceeds the defined threshold is briefed to leadership including the Board of Directors and publically disclosed via SEC reporting. What are the measure(s), metric(s), or indicator(s) used to identify substantive change?The primary metric to identify substantive change is currency in the form of USD. Substantive financial impact could be from lost revenue, missed sales opportunities, increases in costs, and other financial liabilities. Other metrics, such as supply chain and/or logistics disruptions, are quantified by delay time, but ultimately translated into financial impact, which is then included in the ERM process and considered against the materiality threshold. What is the threshold or amount of change in the metric/measure/indicator which indicates substantive change?HPE goes through the process of identifying and measuring impacts to our business on a case-by-case basis. If the aggregated financial impact exceeds the materiality threshold of 5% of operating profits, then the impact is considered substantive and communicated. Does the definition apply to direct operations, or supply chain, or both?The evaluation of business impacts applies to all operations. This includes direct operations and supply chain. Provide at least on example of substantive impact considered. The repeated flooding at our Houston location, specifically Hurricane Harvey, created a strategic impact to our business operations which spurred HPE to move manufacturing out of a coastal location. And subsequently a search for a separate location for employees.
Definition of water risk-related substantive financial or strategic impact on our business: (1) Economic high risk: based on current or future negative financial impacts and potential for negative impact on regional operations or guest experience. (2) Environmental high risk: based on potential for legal non-compliance or negative cost impacts through remediation or recovery efforts. (3) Social high risk: based on potential negative impact on brand, reputation and stakeholder relationships as well as potential for legal non-compliance. Using the WWF Water Risk Filter, we align and evaluate the factors that may potentially impact our current global hotel operations and expansion in specific geographic markets. We also seek to identify specific areas and river basins where Hilton's water stewardship initiatives and engagement would have the greatest value. Measures used to identify substantive change: In our screening of hotels for further analysis and potential inclusion, we initially consider those hotels with an overall WWF basin risk of 3.5 or greater (med high to high). We then evaluate all hotels (managed/direct operations and franchised/value chain) within that river basin over other key risk indicators to determine the primary driver within each basin and to identify priority areas for collective action:(1) Economic high risk is aligned with WWF Physical Risk indicators(2) Environmental high risk is aligned with Regulatory Risk indicators(3) Social high risk is aligned with Reputation Risk indicatorsThreshold indicating a substantive change: Typically, the primary risk type and risk driver will have an average basin risk of at least 4.0. We consider any scores greater than 3.5 to be substantive.Application: The above definition applies to our direct operations and our supply chain.
Substantive financial or strategic impact is defined as 1) an Extremely High risk ranking as determined by the internal water-risk review process or 2) water risk with financial impacts exceeding levels established by the internal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process (scoring and ranking is reviewed and updated annually).
At the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) level, our definition of substantive financial impact for all risks considered including environmental risks aligns with our ERM threshold principles which consider the impact as a certain percentage of operating profit. At the functional level, substantive financial and strategic impact is viewed in the context more specific to the business function, mandate, and operating budget. For our global operations, HP Corporate Real Estate and Workplace Solutions team gauges impact based on risk thresholds and change in costs. For example, a water rate increase of 10% or more is considered substantive for CREWS operating budgets in our direct operations costs. Flood risk is another water risk with substantive impact to our facilities. For risk thresholds, we use the WRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool to assess potential substantive changes and impact in our business and operations due to water stress. HP defines substantive impact from water risk in our operations as facilities that are downgraded to either scarce or extremely scarce renewable water supply per person as defined by the WRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool. For example, in 2017, 2% more HP sites than in 2016 were upgraded based on their level of water risk exposure. Our threshold is when a facility moves from sufficient water supply to stressed status. This applies to all HP operations globally. We apply a similar methodology to our supply chain. For our indirect operations/supply chain, we also gauge substantive impact based on increase in our suppliers' operating costs or potential or actual disruption of product or critical part supply due to water cost, quality or scarcity. Depending on the product and its current inventory, delays in production of, e.g., 1 week or more could significantly impact order fulfillment and product delivery, putting revenue at risk. Such disruptions due to water (other than floods) have not been experienced in our supply chain to a degree that a specific threshold of change has been established. Stakeholder concerns and reputation are two important but more qualitative gauges of substantial strategic impact for both water-related issues in our direct operations and indirect operations/supply chain. The threat or occurrence of negative press or an NGO campaign exposes the company to brand damage. A ''headlineâ€ test is applied internally to evaluate how an issue or action will affect brand perception and the business overall.
Hudbay Minerals identifies substantive change as a significant impact on the economics of a project or operation that would result in a substantial additional capital investment or a significant deterioration in the financial return on an existing investment.
Husky's enterprise risk management program supports decision-making via comprehensive and systematic identification and assessment of risks that could materially impact the results of the Company. Through this framework, the Company builds risk management and mitigation into strategic planning and operational processes for its business units through the adoption of standards and best practices. Husky has developed an enterprise risk matrix to identify risks to its people, the environment, its assets and its reputation, and to systematically mitigate these risks to an acceptable level.Husky defines substantive change as having a financial impact to direct operations of greater than ten (10) million dollars. The corporate risk register is revisited on at least an annual basis, while the matrix is evaluated every three years.An example of a substantive financial impact experienced by Husky was the 16TAN pipeline release in 2016, which resulted in some oil entering the North Saskatchewan River. The cost of this significant event was over $100 million dollars (not incurred by Husky), as reported in the 2017 CDP Water Response.
We would consider a substantive risk to exist only where any of our businesses changed their operations, sources of supply or customer base due to water related matters and such change in any one of our seven business segments was considered significant by that segment or ITW overall.
Substantive impacts would disrupt our ability to deliver products or services to our customers, interfere with meeting the needs of our staff or raise our operating budget by a significant percentage.
We define substantive site-level water risks as any facility (direct operation) meeting all of the following criteria:1. Site is identified as being High or Extremely High risk utilizing our ensemble risk tool methodology;2. Site accounts for >5% of our global production by volume; and3. Site is considered strategic to the growth strategy of the organization.Sites are evaluated against these criteria annually to determine if they meet this definition, indicating a potentially substantive impact.In addition to site level impacts, our Business Continuity Plan (BCP) risk assessment process considers supply chain impacts, including lack of raw material availability (primarily agriculture) due to water-related issues such as droughts and flooding. Substantive risks would include those that have the potential to impact production and ability to meet commitments to our customers. We have also begun evaluating our suppliers by mapping locations in the WWF Water Risk Filter to determine if any are located in areas having annual average monthly net water depletion equal to or greater than 75%.An example of a substantive impact would be a facility needing to curtail production due to lack of water or agricultural raw material availability. In our environmental management system, we define disruption to operations of greater than seven days as high severity. The current probability of this occurring is ranked as unlikely (i.e., has not occurred or may be anticipated to occur less than once/year). This would also result in an impact to our customers if we were to be unable to supply product to them.
Flooding identified as a risks that may have a potential impact on our organization either currently or in the future
Intel's Board of Directors and management consider ''riskâ€ for these purposes to be the possibility that an undesired event could occur that might adversely affect the achievement of our objectives. The types of risks that Intel faces include: â€¢ Macro-economic risks such as inflation, reductions in economic growth, or recessionâ€¢ Political risks such as restrictions on access to markets, confiscatory taxation, and expropriation of assetsâ€¢ Physical risks such as natural disasters (e.g., floods, prolonged drought, etc.)â€¢ Business-specific risks related to strategy and competition, product demand, global operations, manufacturing, cybersecurity and privacy, intellectual property, litigation and regulatory compliance, corporate responsibility and sustainability, corporate governance, and environmental stewardship. Our internal teams also monitor and evaluate reputational risks, such as the community's perception of how we manage our water, particularly in times of prolonged drought, as well as regulatory risks, such as changing regulations that could limit the amount of water used or increase our costs related to water usage. We define a "substantive change" related to water-risk as a change that would impact or influence our business (output or revenue). This is measured through various indicators such as interpretation of public perception (Public Affairs team), potential for any water disruption (Global Supply Management team), potential for legal costs (Public Affairs and Sustainability or EHS Legal Team), or any noticeable impact on our business (revenue impacts or the inability to work in certain areas of the world). The thresholds we use to determine if something would be considered a substantive change include any impacts to production capabilities or resulting revenues, damages to our public image, and changing regulations that would limit our ability for growth or incur a significant cost (such as new water-related costs that could increase operating costs by several million dollars per site). These criteria apply to our direct operations as well as our ability to continue working with our major suppliers.
Water is integrated into this comprehensive and global risk assessment process incorporating both direct and supply chain operations. The approach covers historic and looking into the year ahead to determine relevance of environmental aspects and impact and their associated significance across relevant business organizations. This planning cycle is undertaken at least annually under the requirements of IBM global environmental management system, and as part of our ISO 14001 EMS accreditation.Assessment of risk is based on the nature and scope of IBM's business operations and our interaction with suppliers. IBM does not perceive any unusual water-related risk in our operations or the supply chain outside of those we plan for as part of our ongoing business and risk management processes. These processes look at business risk comprehensively including, but not limited to, anticipating and proactively managing its water-related issues.We anticipate that the business model of both IBM's and our production and service suppliers' operations will enable those operations to anticipate and adapt to potential risks and mitigate the impacts without significant disruptions to our business. Refer to: https://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/ems/ .
We define substantive financial or strategic impact when identifying or assessing water-related risks in both our direct operations and our supply chain as any change that would significantly affect our business, operations, revenue or expenditure.For our direct operations, we use the overall water risk as defined by WRI Aqueduct Tool as the metric to identify water-related risks that could cause â€˜substantive' change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure. The threshold that indicates â€˜substantive change' are areas labeled as ''Highâ€ or ''Extremely Highâ€ by the Aqeuduct tool for our strategic sites. Our strategic sites are those that are critical to operations such as our manufacturing facilities or corporate headquarters. Each site is reviewed annually through WRI Aqueduct and assessed in terms of overall water risk, business growth and strategy. To date, we have not identified a water-related risk for our strategic sites which could cause a substantive change in our business. For example, one substantive impact considered by the tool is the physical risk quantity which assesses reliable access to enough water to maintain operations.In our value chain, water quality and water quantity are important to our supply chain. We measure substantive impact in our supply chain using an internal risk scorecard that incorporates multiple environmental datasets, including the Yale Environmental Performance Index (EPI), which ranks 180 countries on 24 performance indicators across ten issue categories covering environmental health and ecosystem vitality. The result is a risk score measured as high, medium or low, with a change from low to high indicating â€˜substantive change.' One example of a substantive supply-chain impact considered is the risk of reduced or disrupted raw material availability caused by precipitation extremes and droughts. Over the past several years, changes in precipitation extremes and droughts in Brazil, Madagascar, and Florida, USA, have affected the availability and cost of our key natural ingredients, such as orange oil and vanilla.
Ivanhoe defines substantive financial or strategic impacts as those risks, opportunities and other factors that could materially affect our ability to create long term sustainable value.
As part of Huber's Enterprise Risk Management framework, the Company's business unit operational management teams are responsible for conducting regular business risk assessments of our direct operations, ultimately reporting inventoried risks to the corporate level. All such risk assessments should include a financial impact assessment. The methodology utilized to quantify each risk's financial impact is as follows: the undiscounted 3-year EBIDTA at risk with direct reference to each business unit's current 3-year plan-of-record. Business units' risks are elevated to the corporate level if they meet either of the following materiality thresholds: immediate current year impact on annual reported EBIDTA of $10M or greater; or 3-year EBIDTA impact exceeds $30M. Business risks that represent significant reputational, safety or environmental risk, even if they don't exceed the financial metrics, are also brought forward to the Enterprise level review.Huber has no current examples of risks which have met the above thresholds.
Risk can be viewed as the combination of the probability of an event and the impact of its consequences. Events with a negative impact represent risks that can prevent value creation or erode existing value. Generally, risks to the Company's success can be grouped into four categories: (1) Strategic, (2) Operational, (3) Compliance and (4) Financial and Reporting. Climate change risks generally fall in the area of strategic, operational and compliance. Risks and opportunities are prioritized by their relative magnitude and the timeframe in which the risks/opportunity may present itself, as well as our overall ability to control or influence the situation. Risks are rated by impact (from negligible to moderate) and likelihood (remote to highly likely) based on impact on the business (demand, cost, etc) and Trustmark.Substantive strategic impacts are disclosed in this report, which are risks / opportunities with a meaningful impact to JnJ's Trustmark, potential for action that could impede JnJ from manufacturing or distributing some product volume, and are considered possible, likely, more likely or highly likely in the short to long term future. All risks and opportunities disclosed meet the criteria for a substantive strategic impact but do not meet the criteria for a substantive financial risk for the purposes of this report. For example, the drought in Cape Town, South Africa in 2017 qualified as a substantive risk, even though there was no impact to production, because there was a â€˜highly likely' probability of water shortages for that facility where one or more product lines for one or more countries could be affected.
We define substantive as having a material financial impact on the entire enterprise. Although some facilities may be subject to water risks, such risks at the enterprise level are not financially material. Also water was not one of the top-ranked issues in our sustainability survey. At the same time, we see a growing opportunity for us to continue to innovate products and services that help our customers be more resource efficient, including reducing water consumption.
A risk management working team is maintained to assess and report overall strategic and operational risks found in our operations and supply chain. When risks hit certain material thresholds or causes substantive change, the committee reports those risks to company management and the board of directors.Juniper prioritizes risks found to be material. Materiality of an issue is assessed as follows:â€¢ The value, or risk, of the issue to business operations: Using our corporate strategy, Juniper looks at whether the issue represents a significant risk or opportunity to our company or industry? Is it current or emerging? Is it already part of the Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability strategy or does it need to be added?â€¢ The priority of the issue to our stakeholders: Does this issue resonate with our key stakeholders? Is it a subject of NGO campaigns? How does it track in the media? Is it reflected in pending legislation, regulations, or international agreements?â€¢ Peers & competitors: Do Juniper's peers and competitors disclose against this issue? How do they respond?â€¢ Juniper's influence over the issue: To what extent does Juniper have control or influence over the issue through our direct actions, industry associations, or networks?â€¢ Relevant and applicable voluntary global reporting and corporate social responsibility standards and guidelines: Is the issue addressed by the standard disclosures of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct, or by other relevant and applicable global voluntary standards?Juniper's approach to materiality is aligned with the domain solutions & customer verticals of our business strategy. The strategy (referred to as our 2-3-7 strategy) provides a structure & hierarchy for prioritizing the value, or risk, of an issue on Juniper's business operations. It is based on the following approach: Is this issue critical to our customer segments (Telecom, Financial Services, Cable/MSO, National Government, Cloud Providers & Strategic Enterprise Verticals)? Is this issue relevant to our product domains (Campus & Branch, Access & Aggregation, Edge, Core, Data Center, & Cloud Services)? Risks found to be material are then acted on through various management methods.
Kellogg defines substantive change as including but not limited to plant relocation, curtailment of operations, product relocation, interruptions in availability, increased cost for municipal water, increased cost for raw materials, lack of security of supply of raw materials, and significant investment in water reduction/recycling that are likely to happen. The metrics for this would include increased costs, lack of availability causing shut downs, and increased water treatment. The threshold for these indicators would vary from facility to facility but would be assessed against profit and loss and operational budgets. This covers both operations and supply chain.
Material impact to gross profit or business operation.Any condition that may alter our ability to work or function, as well as affect our human and financial capital.
As stated in our annual 10K filing, weather, climate change and the availability of water could adversely affect our business.Water risks could lead to substantive impact through one or more of the following: 1) physical damage 2) increased regulatory constraints, 3) impacts to operations, services, 4) damage to our reputation. This definition is inclusive of indirect impacts to operations, services and our supply chain.To determine if a facility is at risk, Dr Pepper considers the WRI Aqueduct tool, Ecolab Water Monetizer, reliance on water, and collective site water basin exposure. Each site is given a risk score weighted 25 percent for water use and 75 percent for the Aqueduct risk score. Facilities with an overall risk score of â€˜medium to high', â€˜high', or â€˜extremely high' and if they represent substantive risk the individual sites are considered at risk.Sites not identified at risk by the WRI aqueduct are then reviewed against the Water Risk Monetizer results. If there are significant water risk premiums or if they represent substantive risk these, sites are considered at risk.
More than 30% decrease in plant production output or revenue, or 30% increase in operating cost expenditure due to insufficient water supply or increased cost of water supply.
Drought or floods could cause interruptions to the supply chain depending upon where the incident is and when in the build cycle we are.

Question not applicable
A substantive financial or strategic impact is defined as an event that would ultimately delay the timely delivery or quality of a product or service to a customer.A risk matrix that could help to quantify the magnitude, probability and frequency of the impact is currently used within our internal system as a response to known/occurred risk events. At this time, we do not have a water related example that triggered this type of categorization.The risk matrix is made of a leveling categories, A-D, starting from Level A, which is immedidately dangerous, business interuptions more than 1 million dollars or event that triggers community protective measures. The levels go from A-D in decreasing risk. Level D would be a minor event that does not trigger financial impact defined as substantive or external reporting requirements.
Lam Research has not quantified the financial implications of potential water risk to business, operations, revenue or expenditure. Lam does not believe that they are material to the company. In addition, Lam has developed a Business Continuity Plan in the event of any adverse environmental threats and risks that may affect company personnel, assets, and operations.
At the company level, we assess water related risk as part of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program by identifying the risk's likelihood and potential impact. In addition, we also look at the timeframe, management method and cost of management. The scale of the impact severity is defined as ''1â€ for ''minorâ€ which is $0-25 million, ''2â€ for ''moderateâ€, which is $26-100 million, ''3â€ is for ''majorâ€, which is $101-250 million and ''4â€ is for ''severeâ€, which is $251-500 million, and ''5â€ is ''catastrophicâ€ which is over $500 million. When identifying or assessing risks for LVS, substantive financial impact is defined as a scale of impact of $100 million or more. The $100 million threshold is still less than 1% of the company annual revenue. Substantive change is considered to be closure or halting of services from of one our critical tier one suppliers or a change in revenue of $100 million or more in our direct operations.We also evaluate risks through our internal water risk model which leverages two leading industry tools including the WWF Water Risk Filter and WRI Aqueduct tools. To determine whether a property is located in a water stressed area, we average the final risk scores from WWF and WRI, and consider a threshold of greater than 3, which is aligned with industry standards, to be a water stressed region. According to this approach we currently do not withdrawal water from any water-stressed regions.Even though the water related risks exist, there are none that currently have the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on business. We update our assessment on a regular basis.Examples of substantive impacts considered include the disruption to business caused by Typhoon Hato and the resulting disruption to the local water supply. The impacts of the typhoon were not considered substantive as all Sands China Ltd. properties remained at least partially open and all impacts were below the $100 million threshold. This risk was considered detrimental but not substantive. Please see our response to W2.1 to learn more about our recovery and relief efforts as well as our amendments to the Business Continuity Plan. We have also considered the impact of risks realized by our critical tier on suppliers.While the risks might not be ''substantiveâ€ to the entire company, the sustainability team still actively reviews and mitigate climate and water related risks which are material to the department.
Any negative impact is substantive.
As part of Lenovo's overall environmental risk assessment processes, we have identified water consumption and discharge as a significant risk. Our risk assessment process examines likelihood and severity of impact as well as reputational and compliance risks, controls, normal and abnormal conditions, etc.. Substantive change would be considered anything that might have a material impact on Lenovo's financials, business operations continuity, ability to sell products, etc.During FY16/17, we undertook an exercise to map Lenovo's water risk and evaluate water risk management strategies. As part of this exercise, the five highest water risk Lenovo sites were identified. Lenovo tracks utility spending, including water use and discharge fees. Lenovo has not sized costs related to this water risk at these or any other sites at this time. Lenovo recognizes that there are risks related to water in our supply chain and we require supplier reporting of water data. Lenovo has not mapped our supply chain water risks to date. Lenovo recognizes the potential impact of water risks in Lenovo's supply chain and we evaluate water as part of our supplier RBA and other audits. However, we have not yet undertaken a formal risk based assessment of our supply chain water impacts and risks. This is largely because of limited resources and the fact that existing resources are dedicated to higher risk projects, including labor and human rights in the supply chain, climate change and energy, etc.
Substantive change or impact would be anything that would inhibit Lexmark from delivering products or services to our customers on time or on schedule. Such interruptions to business and operations could impact revenues and agreements with our customers.
Lockheed Martin considers water-related risks to be location specific but currently does not deem water to pose a material impact to our business. For the purposes of Water CDP disclosure, we would define substantive change from water-related risks as those that are present within certain regions where we or key suppliers operate that could lead to a 1% deviation from normal business operations (e.g. increased process time, disrupted material flow, supply chain delay, etc.) and/or a change in revenue or costs to the affected facility and/or supplier caused by a water shortage, regulatory water restriction, water-related natural catastrophe, or other water-related impact. This 1% threshold for substantive change is defined only for the purposes of the Water CDP and does not apply as a formal definition to what Lockheed Martin considers to be material or substantive. Water impacts currently do not constitute 1% of deviation in our normal business operations or our supply chain, and thus do not constitute a substantive change. As an example, although we experienced detrimental impacts to our Aguadilla, Puerto Rico facility from Hurricane Maria, this would not constitute as a substantive impact to our overall Corporation because it did not approach the 1% thresholds related to deviations from normal business operations that we defined as substantive impact for the purposes of Water CDP only.Lockheed Martin is not in a water intensive company and therefore does not encounter conflicts with other water users at a local level. Our current water quantity and quality meet our demands without materially impacting the water basins in which we operate. If water were to be identified by our stakeholders in our Core Issues Assessment as a high priority factor, we would consider evolving our definition of substantive change to reflect our stakeholders' concerns and address specific water issues with targeted goals. We will continue to evaluate whether our internal and external stakeholders consider water to be a material impact in the future.
A substantive impact would be any impact resulting in a disruption of our normal operations. Impacts on water supply could result in a shut-down of manufacturing due to lack of water for product cleaning and process cooling systems.
Marriott International is a global lodging company with more than 6,500 properties (as of year-end 2017) that we operate (''manageâ€), franchise or license under 30 brands in 127 countries and territories worldwide. This diversification offers some resilience against localized water risks. A substantive financial impact would be one that would impact overall revenue significantly.
The Mars Facility Water Stewardship Risk Assessment Process considers sites against three separate criteria to assess the level of water-related risks and assess whether these are substantive in business terms.  Sites experiencing the greatest water-related risks and issues are identified based on data obtained in our annual Mars Facility Water Risk Assessment Questionnaire (formerly known as the Mars watershed governance survey) which forms part of a wider sustainability data gathering exercise in support of our SiG Plan.  Sites in locations of high (>40%) baseline water stress as per the WRI Aqueduct tool.  Sites producing more than 2% of their business segment's global production volume. Our Food business is an exception where we set the level at 5%, as it has a much smaller number of sites. The proportion of production volume is an indicator of potential business impact in the event of water issues affecting a factory's ability to operate. Most of our products can be manufactured at multiple sites, reducing business continuity risks in the event of a water-related impact production at one facility. Where this is not the case and a site produces unique products, we may rate the business risk as substantive even if the production volume threshold is not met.(Note: These criteria have changed slightly in 2017 to reflect the merger of our Wrigley and Chocolate business segments. This is to allow the same production percentage threshold to be used for our two largest segments, and to recognize the enhanced business risks faced when brands are manufactured at a single production facility in a water stressed area.)Sites identified as having the highest water-related risks are defined as ''High Priorityâ€ sites within our Water Stewardship program and are the subject of Water Stewardship Reviews based on the Alliance for Water Stewardship's International Standard. The reviews aim to ensure we build on the information from our Facility Risk Assessments and WRI stress data to build a detailed understanding of local water risks and opportunities.Following a successful pilot in the Food segment's Kings Lynn site in the UK in 2016, and three further reviews completed at two sites in the Shanghai area of China and in San Bernardino in California in 2017, we are now rolling out our program to the remaining high priority sites. We aim to complete 20 water stewardship reviews before year-end 2020, and aim to use the review process at new production sites from 2017 onward.Three sites identified as "at risk" in our 2016 response are not considered "at risk" this year. These sites are Melton Mowbray in the UK, Reno USA and Queretaro in Mexico. The Melton and Reno sites have undergone, or are undergoing, water stewardship reviews based on the AWS International Standard, which is providing greater information on watershed level risks. This has resulted in a downgrading in our water related risk assessment for these facilities. The Queretaro site's water risk assessment found that water-shed related risks are lower than last year and this site will be the subject of a Water Stewardship review starting this year.In our supply chain, as part of the accounting process for developing our Sustainable in a Generation Plan, we overlaid our raw material origins and volumes with watershed stress maps in a Geographic Information System, to cross-reference water-intensive crops with areas of water stress. This allowed us to identify priority watersheds that represent substantive supply risks. We have used the results to develop a type of science-based target for reducing our most material water impacts in stressed watersheds. More information on this approach is available at www.wri.org/blog/2016/04/companies-could-profit-setting-water-targets-informed-science and our water position statement on Mars.com(https://www.mars.com/global/about-us/policies-and-practices/water-stewardship-position-statement).

Water is a significant component of many of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to restrictions in certain regions.These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
This is consistent with how McCormick characterizes "enterprise risks" which are risks that 1) expose the Company to significant or catastrophic permanent decline in shareholder value and 2) the risk must be reasonably possible.
Our annual report (form 10-K) defines "substantive" risks as those that could materially adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Risks that rise to this level are captured and discussed in our 10-K in section 1.A, Risk Factors. For more information see http://www.merck.com/investors/
Micron uses a standard ERM process to ensure risks, including water-related risks, can be incorporated into decision-making. The ERM process is aligned with Micron's Strategic and Business Planning Process to ensure appropriate priorities are set and company strategic objectives are met. This creates a unified approach to identify, assess, prioritize, treat, monitor and report risks across the company. As part of the strategic planning process and day-to-day management of the business, internal and external risks that may affect the achievement of our objectives are identified. Water-related risks and overall sustainability risks spanning a 2-6 year time period are identified, assessed, prioritized, and managed as part of this ERM process. Information and communication channels are in place to make the organization aware of risks that fall into their area of responsibility.Micron risk management personnel and subject matter experts assess these risks through their expertise, formal assessments and analysis of business intelligence and trends. Risks and opportunities are then prioritized based upon the overall risk exposure, considered as a function of likelihood (how likely is the risk to occur without treatment) and impact of the occurrence (how impactful is the risk without treatment). Micron leaders are accountable for managing risks affecting their area of responsibility. Risk management personnel are responsible for maintenance and governance of the ERM program, and support the identification, assessment, and reporting of risks to leadership for recommended actions. Each business unit and function communicates identified risks and associated treatments to their leadership teams. The leaders of these functions develop plans and direction for their organization to effectively align the treatment support to the objectives and priorities of the organization. Micron personnel are empowered to make decisions to prioritize risk treatments that is are within their span of control. However, all risks are elevated through the ERM process to identify themes across product lines, sites, and assets. This allows prioritization of risks across multiple locations and functions to receive appropriate attention and review by the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis or more frequently as needed.Micron considers substantive financial impact as having the potential for severe and/or irreversible negative impact to Micron's assets, credit liquidity, and/or share price. Water-related risks and opportunities are identified and prioritized by considering the following criteria: business continuity, impact to brand/reputation, relevance to regional operations, alignment with Micron business strategy, impact to communities, and compliance considerations. One example of our risk/opportunity identification and management process includes the risk of enhanced reporting obligations. The likelihood of this occurring and how impactful it would be without treatment is evaluated to determine the inherent risk and then treatment details, including who, what, and when are determined and tracked to closure. The treatments for this example includes monitoring water-related regulations and policy to understand and evaluate impacts to, and opportunities for, our business, customers, and the communities where we operate. When applicability is determined, an action plan is developed and monitored through execution.
Microsoft defines substantive strategic or financial impact from water-related risks as follows:  For offices and labs, an impact that would require significantly altering or relocating the operations of a facility or group of facilities that would affect our ability to deliver continuous customer services. Our operational analysis includes a three-part filter to identify those facilities representing the greatest potential risk: (1) location in water basins with current or future potential for high baseline water stress; (2) annual average electricity use more than 60 kWh/square foot (large electricity users being datacenters); and (3) if the facility represents more than 1 percent of total companywide electricity use (using electricity as proxy for the size or relative importance of the facility to our company). This applies to direct operations.  For datacenters, an impact that would require significantly altering or relocating a datacenter that would affect our ability to deliver continuous customer services. The reliability tier can vary in the Microsoft service level agreements or contracts with customers. A substantive impact would be one that would prevent a datacenter from delivering the customers' contracted reliability tier. This applies to direct operations.  For our manufacturing sites, an impact that is managed under the Environmental Management System, in alignment with our ISO 14001 Significant Aspects and Impacts process. The Significant Aspects and Impacts process requires the Environmental Management Team to rate each known impact of all our aspects using set criteria including, but not limited to, our ability to deliver continuous customer services or products, force a change in our business strategy, and impact local communities, employees, or contractors. Impacts are considered ''significantâ€ when they exceed a defined numerical value. This applies to direct operations.  For our suppliers, an impact that would block or delay the delivery of contracted goods or services to the extent that it would affect our ability to deliver continuous customer services or force a change in our business strategy (including, but not limited to, when supplier working conditions no longer meet requirements for the supplier's workplace as a result of a water-related impact). This applies to our supply chain.  For our business overall, an impact that would lead us to alter our business strategy as a result of changes in return on investment, capital expenditures, or the cost of key supplies. This applies to both direct operations and supply chain.Our products and services have minimal water impacts in other stages of the value chain.We review our approach biannually as part of the Microsoft Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, as well as when we respond to the CDP water questionnaire. The ERM program has a formal process for assessing the size, scope, and relative significance of the various risks that Microsoft faces, including those related to water. The process involves categorizing risks according to their inherent impact on a scale of 1 (minimal) to 5 (critical) in four categories: trust or reputational; operational scope; legal, compliance, or environmental; and enterprise value. Risks are then rated according to their inherent likelihood on a scale of 1 (remote) to 5 (expected). These two ratings are used to produce a ''risk impactâ€ score, and any risk for which the risk impact score exceeds a defined threshold is considered material for reporting to senior management. The rating of specific risks by inherent impact and likelihood is made through consultation with subject matter experts from across the company; in the case of risks related to water, this subject matter leadership resides with the Environmental Sustainability (ES) team, led by the Chief Environmental Strategist. The ES team consults across the company and uses formal risk assessments to inform the process.An example of a substantive impact considered is the potential for facility damage from an acute weather event, such as flooding. To mitigate this risk, Microsoft has an established Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program, to help ensure the existence of effective, reliable, well-tested plans, systems, and processes that can be counted on during a disruptive event to support continuity of business operations and minimize adverse impacts. The EBCM program works with the ERM team to ensure consistent alignment among risks and risk ratings. (Note that this risk is not substantive; central to Microsoft cloud services design is geographic redundancy, which reduces our vulnerability to physical impacts, including flooding, and offers customers the option of a resilient alternative to on-premises datacenters.)
As ModusLink's water consumption is primarily used for human consumption and sanitation, it does not pose significant risks to interruption of production. ModusLink defines substantive risks as risks that could affect greater than 1% of the company's total revenue.

We define a substantive financial or strategic impact as one that would result in a material change in the cost to produce products or the ability to produce products or grow into new markets.
Although we do not use water within our manufacturing processes, we consider our company and supply chain subject to risks related to water, but do not consider the risks to be significant. Like all companies, extreme weather events and resource shortages have the potential to interrupt our business and supply chain operations. However, Motorola Solutions' operations generally are not located in low-lying areas subject to severe impacts from flooding or drought. Any disruption to our distribution channels could have a detrimental impact on our supply chain and product distribution. Losses and interruption could be caused by water shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters, for which we predominantly are self-insured.

A substantive change to our organization for both our direct operation and supply chain is one that is material to the company. To understand the potential for substantive change, our risk identification and assessment process goes through a multi-pronged approach. We rate risks on factors such as impact, severity, frequency, and likelihood. We temper this with a look into our controls/mitigations in place or in process. This process is conducted on an ongoing basis, but reported out to the executives on a quarterly cadence. Our rating scale has several elements such as financial impact, regulatory, customer impact, reputational, etc. Water related risks including water scarcity and extreme storms are included in these analyses of the potential for substantive risk. For example, droughts could have an impact on operating expenses at our Sunnyvale facility (if tiered water rates change) as well as on capital expenditures if we are required to retrofit some of our existing cooling towers to reduce the consumption of domestic water. In addition, water availability could affect the prices of our components, since a number of our suppliers (e.g., semiconductor manufacturers) can use significant amounts of water in their manufacturing processes.
Newmont defines substantive financial impacts on the business as follows:A significant operation change or expenditure greater than $1 million. Elements of substantive change include the following:- Rapidly increasing social, political and media concern leading to project delays, increased costs- Increasing pressure on water use due to in-migration of communities in proximity to our operations that could impact our operations- Water scarcity and water surplus leading to production constraints and increased costs- Increasingly stringent regulations focused on water management and discharge requirements leading to increased costs- Increasing financial exposure at closure due to increasingly stringent regulations and water treatment costsNewmont defines substantive strategic impact on the business as follows:  Significant risk: Newmont's Risk Management Standard defines significant risks as those risks that are identified as "high" or "extreme", as defined on the Newmont Risk Matrix.  Strategic risk: Newmont defines strategic risks as a long-term risk (e.g. three years) that sets the overall direction of the organization with respect to the Health and Safety, Sustainability and External Relations, and Business planning.Newmont considers water a material issue and emerging risk; continuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining operations.Our 10K 2017 Annual Report (pg 24) discusses the potential business impact of the risk (excerpted here), "Our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our operations in North and South America and Australia are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights, claims and contracts and to defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings...Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company's control... The loss of some or all water...rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities."
NIPSCO electric generation relies on adequate water for purposes of appropriate non-contact cooling. Insufficient water would limit our ability to operate.
We produce aluminum sheet and light gauge products for use in multiple markets, which includes beverage can. Our single largest end-use market is beverage can sheet. The beverage market is highly dependent on fresh clean water as a key raw material, within the manufacturing process and other product ingredients. Certain of our customers in the beverage market are significant to our revenues, and we could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of these significant customers or by the loss of their business.
NRG's definition of substantive water risk is the possibility that an event will occur and significantly alter the achievement of NRG's business goals. Risk identification and assessment process applies to both direct operations and supply chain. NRG uses the measures, metrics and indicators for water risk assessment leveraging the management and professional judgment from the following perspectives: â€¢Financial impact:  1)Corporate earnings 2)Capital expenditure on technologies to reduce water consumption and withdrawal  â€¢Plant operation  1)Operation disruption due to water shortage 2)Increase in costs of water usage 3)Supply chain risk â€¢Environmental impact 1)Water availability  2)Water quality of river basins 3)Regulations that impact supply and/or management of waterWater risk is monitored by the risk owners (individual plant operators) and reported to management upon material changes with a threshold of 20% in water consumption and withdrawal levels. Water risks for the purposes of this disclosure are considered to have substantive financial impact to NRG's business if they could impact a significant proportion of the company's gross margin from power generation in a given region. If it is determined that a water supply risk exists that could impact projected generation levels within any plant within the subsequent two year time frame, risk mitigation efforts are identified and economically evaluated for implementation. NRG SVP, Plant Operations reviews modelling scenarios generated for water risk determination. Plant level NRG Water usage analysis is reviewed annually. NRG water usage analysis is reviewed by the senior leaders of NRG Operations, Engineering and Commercial Operations.
With input from our finance team, we have created thresholds for determining climate risks and opportunities that present a substantive financial impact for our business for CDP reporting. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we determined that an event or series of events that cumulatively cause in any given quarter $6 million in lost or additional revenue and/or $4 million in additional or reduced Cost of Goods Sold or Operating Expenses qualifies as a substantive financial impact.
Occidental follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which has defined rules for oil and gas reporting disclosures with the aim to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves and financial valuation. These same rules cover guidance regarding the types of issues an oil and gas company should consider when preparing its Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) in its Form 10-K and other financial filings, including disclosure regarding substantive financial impact (or changes) due to technology, prices and concession conditions.
Operations at a few plants require a significant quantity of water. Therefore, water related risks have the potential to cause substantial change in direct business operations. Depending on severity and the likelihood of water challenges derived from the watershed/basin, it might impact local business units as well as revenue or expenditure at global level. To determine the included facilities we identify all sites listed as having "high" or "extremely high" overall water risk from the Aqueduct Tool. This takes quality, quantity, flooding, endandered species, seasonal variability and other impacts into consideration. We then cross reference that with our water use and production levels at each of those sites. To be considered significant the total amount of production from those sites within the basin must be above 3%. Once plants cross both the high risk and 3% production in the basin threshold they are considered to have the potential of substantive change on our business. We use our supplier segmentation process to identify those suppliers that are critical to our operations based on a variety of risk factors including availability of substitutions and level of spend. Based on the results of the segmentation process suppliers representing 87% of our spend go through additional water risk assessments including the Aqueduct Tool.
PepsiCo incorporates the following factors when defining substantive change in PepsiCo's direct operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk: 1) magnitude of potential impact on operating costs and/or current and future revenue; and 2) potential impact on stakeholder expectations or perceptions. Substantive change would generally be considered any material change (+/- 5%) to a site's operating environment/costs and/or to PepsiCo's reputation locally, regionally or globally. Should such material change occur, the impact (and any potential need to review the definition) would be reviewed and re-assessed by our senior executive team. This definition of substantive change applies to both direct operations and to elements of our supply and value chains (for example, changes to how we source agricultural raw materials due to water-related risks).
Business interruption due to flooding associated with storm water or interruption of water supply
For the purposes of this response, Pfizer defines ''substantiveâ€ risk as any impact that could adversely impact the company's business or financial condition or disrupt, delay or inhibit the supply of medically-necessary products to patients. For risks that can be evaluated financially, Pfizer has applied a threshold of $100MM for considering a risk substantive in this context. Pfizer defines ''medically-necessaryâ€ products as those products identified by our internal businesses to provide treatment for a life-threatening condition for which there are no alternatives available. Pfizer applies these criteria when assessing both direct and indirect risks and opportunities.CDP's phrasing of "substantive" and our response to questions presenting "substantive" risks should not be considered to relate to matters or facts that could be deemed ''materialâ€ to a reasonable investor as referred to under U.S. securities laws or similar requirements of other jurisdictions. Investors should refer to disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ("10-k") and in our other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K, for a discussion of "material" matters.
Water risks for PG&E are defined as those that have a strategic impact on PG&E's business of providing safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy for its customers and impact the long-term sustainability of PG&E as a company. PG&E recently refreshed its third-party led materiality assessment, which identified priorities for the long-term sustainability of our business. Developed through a structured process that included interviews with internal and external stakeholders, the assessment identified numerous material issues, including PG&E's GHG emissions, renewable energy, and climate change resilience. PG&E's Corporate Sustainability team then worked with the Corporate Strategy team to ensure the results of the materiality assessment informed and were appropriately reflected in PG&E's business strategy. Our water-related risk management efforts focus primarily on drought mitigation, climate change, once-through cooling, land subsidence, groundwater management, storm water, drinking water, water use and recycling, and discharge limitations.
In relation to substantive change, we refer to materiality - material issues are identified in a multidisciplinary way and include those which:- have the highest potential impact and a realistic probability of occurrence;- are most relevant to our enterprises and geographic locations; and- are most important to our stakeholders. In 2020+ risk forecasting terms, higher level risks are defined as those with a potential impact in excess of US$5M or a raw material impact in excess of 1000 metric tonnes of tobacco leaves. These apply to both our direct operations and our tobacco supply chain.Over the last couple of years, we have been expanding our water programs by first assessing current and future water-related risks more broadly across our value chain. These risks include water scarcity and water quality in tobacco growing regions, flood risk in major tobacco warehouse locations and ports, and water demand in cities where we have manufacturing facilities. Besides our tobacco supply chain, we have developed a water footprint analysis with Quantis to understand water stressed hotpots from which we source materials that are production water intensive.
Pinnacle defines substantive financial or strategic impact to our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk using multiple variables - however, the most relevant indicator that is considered is the size of the impact to our business. Pinnacle understands that climate change can affect crop seasons, water supply, and weather patterns which can have a substantive impact on the way that we do business. Risk size is determined by financial impact. As an example, risks are gauged by the dollar impact on earnings, assigned a probability and ranked by the size of the risk. A large portion of key ingredients and materials that we use in our products are highly dependent on the availability of water. Our supply chain faces the largest risks due to changes in water availability and quantity which in turn, could result in higher costs for Pinnacle as well. Our Procurement Leadership Team utilizes a supply chain risk management program that is designed to allow the Company to identify and manage risks inherent in its external supply chain, which includes assessing substantive changes in our business due to water risks. Substantive changes in our supply chains are defined by overall risk and materiality to our business.Our direct operations also rely on the availability of water and our production operations could be impacted by change in weather patterns. Because of the diversity of agricultural inputs in Pinnacle's product portfolio, each single item does not create a significant risk and there exists generally supply alternatives. Additionally, the vast amount of Pinnacle's operations and supply chain are located in North America with limited exposure to broad risks.
APS defines substantive change to our business related to water risk in three ways. First, a physical disruption of a water supply constitutes a substantive and disruptive change. If a vital piece of infrastructure is damaged or becomes inoperable, output could be impacted or generation could be curtailed entirely. Second, noncompliance with a permit or regulatory requirement could impact production and/or result in notices of violations and penalties. Finally, allocation cuts related to water shortages would impact production.
We define substantive financial or strategic impact to our business as those events having an impact on sales or earnings, on our operations or those of our key suppliers, or on the ability of our customers to effectively use our products.
Our organization defines a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business that has a 0.5% impact revenue or earnings per share.PVH's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process identifies risks most material to the business. Risks are ranked based on likelihood and control comfort. Sourcing risk, identified as a top risk through the ERM process, includes the potential for natural disasters (e.g., floods, droughts) and volatile commodity costs, particularly in key sourcing countries. In addition to PVH's ERM process, we undertook a water risk assessment in 2016. Per WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter tool, three types of risks are identified; physical risk, reputational risk and regulatory risk. Physical risk is defined as water quantity (e.g., scarcity, flooding, and droughts) and quality (pollution) within the river basin and the impacts this might have on society and the environment. Regulatory risk is defined as the strength and enforcement of water regulations and the consequences of restrictions by public institutions; either felt through direct regulatory action or from neglect, blockages or failure. Reputational risk is defined as perceptions around water use, pollution and behavior that may have negative impacts on the company brand and influence purchasing decisions. Public perceptions can emerge rapidly when local aquatic systems and community access to water are affected. Additionally, substantive changes will impact availability, continuity, price, quality, delivery time and reliability of the supply base or the public opinion that impacts sourcing performance, sourcing strategy and/or the company reputation.To determine which PVH supplier facilities were exposed to water risks we utilized both the water risk assessment data provided by the WWF Water Risk Filter Tool and the Higg Facility Environmental Module data. In the roll out of the Higg FEM, it was determined that a selection of Tier 1 Level 1, Mills and Wet Processors were priority facilities based on several criteria. 23 of the priority facilities, when cross referenced with data from the WWF Water Risk Filter tool, were in basins with an overall score by the WWF Water Risk Filter tool that categorized their location as high risk or very high risk.
Qualcomm's annual risk assessment of our operations includes the consideration, review and prioritization of various company risks by a cross-functional group of key representatives from legal, finance, human resources and internal audit. A substantive change for both our direct operations and our supply chain is one that is material to the company. When conducting a risk assessment to identify material risks, we consider the scale of the potential financial impact and the likelihood of the impact on our key business drivers, including employee attraction and retention, future growth strategy, innovation, meeting customers' needs, and supply chain management. Materiality is determined by combining a risk's scores on a variety of business and environmental indices according to a proprietary weighting formula.

Raytheon defines substantive financial or strategic change to our business impact that would impact our operations to the point where we could not meet our customers' needs. This impact is defined as us not being able to maintain production schedule, meet our production quotas and compromise employees' safe working conditions due to water risks, climate change water-related impacts, extreme weather or lack of availability. Raytheon has an enterprise risk management (ERM) process that is designed to identify risks across the Company with input from each business and function. Various business risks are identified, assessed and prioritized. The process is run by Raytheon's Enterprise Preparedness Council, which is comprised of Corporate Vice Presidents from Security, Human Resources, Global Business Services, and Communications. The program aligns with standards for business continuity management, such as ISO 22301. Businesses and Corporate entities conduct Threat and Vulnerability Assessments (TVAs) on a periodic basis to evaluate a wide range of potential risks and threats. Tools and risk assessment methodologies are provided to the Business to use. Raytheon maintains a mature system to identify, track and assess the impact of natural and human disasters as part of its preparedness planning strategy. The system is based on geocoding of facilities and employees. In addition, Raytheon's suppliers are included in the geocoding as part of the incident awareness tool. The key functional organizations involved in identification of weather related risks and opportunities are: Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability (EHSS), Office of General Counsel, Facilities, Engineering, Supply Chain, Global Business Services, and Business Continuity. At the asset and facility level process - Risks and opportunities are identified and assesses in very similar ways as at a company level, including: a) each site and Business has Business Continuity / Emergency Planning professionals that conduct Threat and Vulnerability Assessments and evaluate all different types of risks and site-specific risks, including those associated with climate change, such as storm events and flooding, and b) each Business has Energy professionals, and Environmental professionals that examine risks and opportunities of individual sites relating to water consumption and availability, utility costs and regulatory compliance.As part of our process to identify the 9 sites below, we used a 1% of total water usage as a guidance for identifying sites with de minimis influence. The de minimis list was reviewed prior to excluding any site purely by water totals, in an effort to ensure the thoroughness of the analyses. This process is applied to our direct operations.
Regeneron defines a substantive financial or strategic business impact from water risks to be anything that disrupts the business across four Business Impact Analysis criteria. The four impact criteria include financial materiality, compliance, operational and competitive edge, and shareholder/stakeholder confidence value. These impacts are rated on a scale with six levels: very low, low, medium, high, very high and extreme. The BIA criteria are written and re-evaluated at least two times per year by a collaborative effort between Real Estate and Facilities Management, Security, and Environmental Health and Safety. Water-related risks are identified and assessed within these BIA criteria. A risk with a medium to extreme impact would result in a substantive financial impact costing greater than $50M. An example of this would be the magnitude of extra operational expenses incurred as a result of a manufacturing site's inability to access fresh water. Regeneron considers this to be a low potential risk in the short-term, but understands that limited access to fresh water may affect long term viability as the company continues to expand. This definition only applies to our direct operations and does not include considerations to our suppliers' water related risks.
Substantive change would mean either the inability to operate one of our facilities due to conditions of flooding, drought, inability to meet environmental regulations, unacceptable compliance cost, or significant changes to fiber supply.
Rockwell defines substantive change to our business to be when more than 5% of operations, revenue or expenditure is impacted, at the corporate level. This threshold is then applied to reporting water-related substantive risks. For example, if a supply-chain is disrupted as a result of prolonged drought in one region and this contributes to a reduction in production globally but it is less than 5% at the corporate level. Consequently this risk would NOT be reported in question W3.2d as an example of a water risk that could cause a substantive change to business, operations, revenue or expenditure as it did not exceed the threshold for substantive change to our business at the corporate level.
Sempra Energy's 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission identifies the risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The 10-K identifies a few risk factors that are or could be a result of water-related issues, particularly drought. However, for transparency purposes, in this response we have also included additional water-related risks that we have identified. These risks do not meet the threshold of materiality relevant to our 10-K filing, but we believe are useful in providing to context to the significance of water in our operations and supply chain and therefore merit inclusion in this discussion
Using the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool, we determined which major manufacturing and distribution facilities were located in water-stressed regions (having a "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk as determined by the tool) . Substantive change will depend on how much product is produced or distributed from that facility as a percentage of total operations.

Water is required for certain operations in Brazil's manufacturing site. It is critical to have water available as this contributes to 40-50% of the production.
Essentially anything that would have any financial or strategic impact is considered. A further review by those with knowledge of the impact determines if the impact is substantive and if any action is required. The variety of potential impacts is such that no sprecific thresholds are defined.
A substantive change would be defined as disruption in operations lasting one day or more. For instance, if it was impossible to provide sufficient drinking water to workers and offices needed to be evacuated or activities on construction site would have to stop. Some projects rely on "On time delivery" and if delivery of critical components was delayed because of an acute weather event or a significant change in physical conditions, the calendar of the project could also be disrupted.
We define substantive strategic impact as a situation or circumstance such as the potential temporary or permanent closure of an operation or facility, which compromises our manufacturing processes, upstream and downstream supply chains, and so compromises our provision of products and services to our customers. It may also include opportunities with limited financial benefit, but provide a water efficiency improvement that contributes to SBD's 2030 CSR Goals, and in turn the UN Sustainable Development Goals.A temporary or permanent closure of an operation or facility could be caused by a situation where the welfare or health and safety of our employees is compromised. Each of our individual sites represents no more than 1% of the overall revenue, but we still regard this as being a financially substantive impact. Therefore, we define the substantive financial impact as any situation where at least a single facility with less than 1% overall revenue is impacted. This would be the highest magnitude impact, however, the probability for such is extremely low (no previous or foreseeable occurrences), and we account for this with business continuity planning. Fresh quality water is important to our operations (we are not reliant on recycled water); however, we have a relatively low estimated overall water risk and are not a water intensive consumer in terms of manufacturing process or sourcing etc. Local site's emergency management plans capture basic business continuity issues, i.e. loss of services such as water and power. Due to the geographical spread of operations (manufacturing, supply chain and administration), it is unlikely that a water related event in a region would impact multiple facilities. In W4.1.c we identified facilities which in case of a water related incident (i.e. insufficient water quantity or quality) poses a substantive impact on SBD's GTS Business. GTS is the largest business unit with the highest revenue within SBD. Each identified site represents less than 1% of the overall revenue. To this end, the realistic worst-case scenario being a complete loss of a manufacturing facility in a region, would only accumulate to less than 1% of overall revenue. Shareholder / customer concerns and water related risk are in scope of our business continuity for each site, as we follow a localization model of â€˜make where we sell'. An example of a business continuity plan would be if a manufacturing process was impacted by regional water scarcity, it may be mitigated by increasing output in parallel manufacturing processes in non-impacted regions. SBD's global Water Risk Plan has foundation in our 2012 strategic communication, our 2013 launch of our global water scarcity strategy, and our 2014-16 updates including establishment of 2015 re-baseline global water withdrawal intensity heavily reliant on the WRI Aqueduct data and 2020 reduction target. This in-process management method includes mapping SBD global locations against the United Nations Environment Program's vital water graphic layers for a multi-faceted risk evaluation to prioritize top water risk sites. Then, instituting water conservation efforts, governmental collaboration projects, and options for alternative water strategies at high risk sites. Sites in high or extremely high-water risk areas are re-assessed annually, to determine local risk and actions towards water security. We also use this management method to assess water risk potential during acquisition transaction due diligence.
Substantive change would be any change considered material to our financial results, such as impacting a significant number of stores in a region, as well as changes which would require significant capital investment. We review our business annually during development of our operating plan and review progress against this quarterly. While local water issues such as the Flint water crisis or the California drought have had impacts on our operations on stores in those regions, the financial impact was not significant enough to deem this a financial risk to Starbucks. We recognize those water challenges are serious in those communities, Starbucks is always doing it's best to help, whether it's providing safe drinking water or installing drought tolerant landscaping, Starbucks always aims to be good community water stewards.
Substantive financial or strategic impacts include: political, social and economic uncertainties or unrest in countries; compliance with laws and regulations may be difficult, burdensome or expensive; changes in economic climate; access to financial markets; changes in healthcare laws and reimbursement; product related regulations and claims; tax and trade risks; and, competition.
Suncor uses an enterprise-wide risk management system (ERM) to assess and define risk. Like most ERM systems it uses a matrix that determines the consequence of a risk and the likelihood of it occurring. There are six (6) consequence and likelihood categories. The ERM assign risks a ranking from I to IV for economic, environmental and social. Social is further broken down into Health & Safety, Reputation and Regulatory with guidance. Suncor defines substantive risks that are risked rank at II or I; To define substantive change for the purpose of this assessment; an economic value of $10M was used. This includes direct financial costs and lost opportunity value (LOV).
For CDP reporting, we consider risks and opportunities that could deliver $10 million or more revenue change or a $5 million or more operating cost change within a given year to represent a substantive financial impact. The scope of this definition includes risks and opportunities arising in the direct, supply chain (upstream) and customer (downstream) segments of our value chain. Examples of potential impacts taken into consideration include increased operating costs should water prices rise in the event of prolonged water shortages, lost business if we do not meet customer expectations or are unable to meet customer demand for our hardware products if our manufacturing supply chain is negatively impacted by water-related events such as severe flooding.
Substantive change in our direct operations is measured primarily by financial impact. With respect to water, substantive change is based upon a high-level assessment of water risks at our operating locations that could result in a "High" or "Very High" financial impact based on EBITDA and a "highly likely/imminent" or "frequently" likelihood as defined in Sysco's proprietary Risk Rating Criteria. Estimated CY2017 EBITDA at risk is used to determine the appropriate Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High financial impact category, while likelihood of the risk is used to determine the extremely unlikely, unlikely, occasionally, highly likely/imminent, and frequently likelihood category.
A substantive impact is an impact that could potentially be material to our business and would require disclosure through reports and filings.
Target considers multiple factors in evaluating risk. Target considers risks substantive when they are assessed to be high or critical using proprietary criteria. Importantly, something that has a "substantive financial or strategic impact on our business" is not necessarily "material" to investors as defined by the SEC.
We define substantive change from water risks, to our direct operations, to include:- sanctions corresponding to an interruption of production or cessation of activity for a short-term but finite duration; - significant, longer-term or offsite community or environmental impact requiring significant mitigation or additional long-term controls; and/or, - financially, we define a substantive change to an operation using a cost threshold.We use these definitions to determine the severity of incidents and in 2017 we did not have any incidents that met these thresholds.
Tessy's definition of a substantive change from water risk would be on direct operations and be the inability to withdraw from local municipalities enough water to operate 60% of Tessy's roughly 260 injection molding presses, which maintains a high enough revenue to pay for operational costs. A 30-day safety stock of critical customer components is warehoused to mitigate this potential change in Tessy's operations and revenue for the short-term. Tessy Plastics a family owned and operated contract manufacturer of injection molding production, for example the presses used,
Water is an essential part of manufacturing semiconductors. We use it to create deionized water â€“ a critical component in our production process. Because water is so important to our operations â€“ and to the communities where we operate, we take great care to use it responsibly and efficiently. Conserving water also enables us to reduce costs, ensure long-term availability and preserve this natural resource. Currently, we monitor the availability of water in the areas where we operate, but have no concerns that would require substantive changes in our operations (such as any changes to our manufacturing output.)
We assess our enterprise and local water risk through an internal tool (Nautilus) wich is based on the WRI/aqueduct tool but includes additional and historic data for our business. Water risks in Nautlius are assessed under 6 categories, each containing several risk factors, as below, which are broadly aligned with the SDGs. Furthermore, each risk factor contains detailed descriptions of the indicators we track to assess the vulnerability of each of our facilities and our business to each risk factor:1. Supply reliability, which includes Infrastructure, Water Supply Policy, Episodic Events, Legal Access to Water, Source Water Availability2. Water efficiency, which includes Current Water use ratio (internal water efficiency metric) vs. Benchmark, Water minimization efforts, Government efficiency policies3. Water economics (including waste water), which includes Wastewater cost, Water supply and treatment cost4. Product quality and safety, which includes Influent Water Quality, Raw Water Monitoring5. Watershed sustainability, which includes Quantity stress, Quality stress, Policy Effectiveness6. Local Community & Social license, which includes Water Access / Sanitation Equity, Outreach activities, Community engagement, Local Government Interactions, Media Coverage.All risk factors are accounted for on a points-based scale, which is then applied in sections of 'very low - low - medium - medium high - high 'water risks. We account for water risks across the business in several ways:- number of bottling facilities in areas with medium-high or high water risk- number of unit cases of product affected in facilities operating in areas with medium-high or high water risk- in the future we will also account for number of high-value brands affected and numbers of litres of water used in areas with medium-high to high water risk.- as we will exapnd our water use assessment for the supply chain, we will include: number of commodities and amount of procurement spend sourced from areas with medium-high/high water risk,Based on these risk factors, we identify strategic impacts to be substantive changes we are able to bring about in the following strategic areas of importance to our company:- Manufacturing facility performance (efficiency, reuse, stormwater management, and wastewater treatment), (KBI: litres of product per litre of water used per facility (taarget -25% between 2010 and 2020) and number of facilities in compliance with tour waste water and stormwater management requirements)- Replenishment of product water use: By 2020, safely return to communities and nature an amount of water equal to what we use in our finished beverages and their production. (KBI: litres of annual sales volume versus litres of water benefits generated)As an example of how substantive strategic change has been achieved, in 2015, we were able to achieve our Replenish target early and have continued to improve on that number in 2016 and 2017. In 2017, we replenished 248 billion liters of water, which amounts to 150% of what we use in our finished beverages and their production. The replenish projects we support focus on- improving safe access to water and sanitation (KBI: # of projects, # of people with access to safe drinking water and sanitation faciltiies);- protecting watersheds by improving water storage and water quality (KBI: # of projects; # of litres of water captured/stored or singificantly improved; # of hectares of forests protected/reforested- providing water for productive use, for example in farming. (KBI: # of projects; # of litres of water captured for usage; # of farmers benefitting)Replenish volume contributions from these projects are 79 percent for protecting watersheds; 15 percent for water for productive use; and 6 percent for safe access to water and sanitation. Of central importance to the health of our communities is access to clean water and sanitation. Nearly 3 million people have gained access to sustained access to safe drinking water through our water programs. Contributing greatly to this achievement are our Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN) and our New World partnership. At the end of 2017, RAIN had provided safe drinking water to more than 2.8 million people in Africa and supported water, sanitation and hygiene programs in over 2,000 communities across 40 African countries.For the remainder of this section and question 5, however, (specifically on quantitative responses in W4.1b, W4.1c, W4.2 and W5), we are only responding as The Coca-Cola Company, not suppliers, independent or franchise bottling partners, or other entities that are not part of Company manufacturing operations. Many of our largest independent franchise bottling partners will also be responding to this questionnaire, and from the perspective of their direct operations, will be in a position to respond appropriately to this section.
Dow recognizes that water availability can change at any given moment in time.The complexity and consequences of the water cycle are closely monitored to ensure Dow's ability to operate safely andefficiently. At several sites scenarios have been formulated examining the impact of long and mid-term changes in water quantity and quality. For example, Dow Aratu qualified as a second tier in Dow'swater risk analysis, having suffered from a drought in 2017, is currently reviewing the results of a water reliability study aim at developing initial design concepts and corresponding order-of-magnitudecost estimates for viable water supply scenarios defining an appropriate contingency plan.
In this context, we define substantive as issues that could have a material impact on our business.
The Kraft Heinz Company defines substantive as an issue or situation that either has a high likelihood of occurring or carries a high degree of significance to our business.

Currently in the process of integrating climate and water related issues in overall Trimble's business objectives and strategy to define its substantive financial or strategic impact in our business as well as to ensure compliance for future regulations.

Tyson Foods, Inc. does not have a comprehensive definition of ''substantive impact,â€ though, as a publicly-traded company, Tyson Foods, Inc. is subject to various regulatory and contractual standards related to the measurement, reporting, and disclosure of impacts to the company's business. Many of these standards are financial- and/or risk-based and are publicly available. We are committed to the responsible management of our water resources, and acknowledge that significant changes in water availability could have an impact on our company and supply chain. We recognize water of suitable quality and volume is a finite resource. That's why, we maintain a goal to reduce the amount of water used to produce each pound of product by 12%, by the end of 2020, using Fiscal 2015 as the baseline year. In addition, we announced in May 2017 a collaboration with the World Resources Institute (WRI) to become an industry leader by setting outcome- based water conservation targets for our operations and our supply chain. We anticipate announcing the results of this collaboration in 2018.
Climate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures â€“ As a railroad with a vast network, we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, extreme temperatures, and significant precipitation. Line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network and can adversely affect revenue, costs, and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Union Pacific integrates water risks/opportunities into a multi-disciplinary Company-wide risk management process. Union Pacific utilizes an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process to incorporate input from Strategic Planning, Operations, Law, and the Environmental Management Group, among others, to identify potential water related risks and opportunities. Each element plays a role in the management of risks and opportunities and evaluation of materiality and priorities. In each case, the criteria for materiality and priorities are dictated first and foremost by an analysis of impacts to safety. Evaluation of impacts to ethics, customer service, and the environment also dictate materiality and priorities. These criteria and priorities are not mutually exclusive and overlap. Union Pacific assesses these impacts in terms of likelihood and magnitude of the impact, determines a response strategy, and monitors progress.From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation that occur in connection with our business. We routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and, when necessary, we seek input from our third-party advisers when making these assessments. Consistent with SEC rules and requirements, we describe below material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business), material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, other proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental laws and regulations (including governmental proceedings involving potential fines, penalties, or other monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000), and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate.
UTC uses the "substantive" definition included in CDP guidance and defines a substantive impact to our businesses to be those events that have a significant impact on UTC's overall corporate performance. This would include events that resulted in a substantial impact to sales revenue, total company profit, corporate reputation and strategic plans.
Varian defines â€˜substantive' on a case-by-case basis, evaluating impacts to operations, supply chain, product quality, customer satisfaction, employee health & safety, and reputation. Potential substantive impacts may include increased capital costs or operational expenditures, disruption or delays in production. Substantive changes are measurable year over year.Varian prioritizes risks and opportunities by evaluating several criteria, including: the return on investment in conjunction with the degree of urgency (evaluated via potential magnitude of financial impact and likelihood of occurrence), potential for increased operational efficiencies and reduced costs. For example, Varian prioritizes those risks likely to cause business continuity issues or potentially disrupt production or operations. Opportunities may be escalated based on customer or employee interest or on their potential for attracting or retaining talent.

Forced to alter or move production due to flooding or total lack of available water.
Waste Management defines substantive strategic impact as events that directly impact the day-to-day operations of our facilities for an extended period of time, not only in terms of additional costs to maintain operations but also in potential lost revenues from the inability to service our customers via collection, hauling, and disposal of materials. WM has sites that operate in a variety of regions, therefore the magnitude of the individual financial impacts of these operational disruptions will vary from site to site.For example, virtually any of WM's landfill sites in the U.S. and Canada are vulnerable to intermittent drought conditions, flood conditions or both. These significant weather pattern changes can impact the behaviors of materials decaying in a controlled MSW landfill environment. Flooding can impede the collection of landfill gas by filling collection wells with water; drought can reduce the rate of decay of organic material because water is essential to the decay process. Both extreme conditions result in additional labor being required to manage the landfill gas collection system, with additional liquids collection required to respond to excess moisture, and with adjustments to the gas collection system vacuum required to respond to the decrease in gas generation resulting from too little moisture. This can also create roadblocks for the productivity of the landfill gas-to-energy portion of our business.For this analysis, we include those sites that are listed with a ''Highâ€ or ''Extremely Highâ€ Overall Water Risk, as indicated by the WRI Aqueduct Tool.
Suez follows country-specific accounting and reporting principles.
There are not constraints on our operations related to water use due to our Great Lakes basin and Mississippi River basin operating locations. Therefore, we do not have metrics used to define substantive change to our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk.
At Western Digital, materiality analysis takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors. For the quantitative analysis, we consider the impact on various financial metrics depending on the circumstances, such as: revenue; total, current or fixed assets; cash and cash equivalents; operating income; working capital; and net income. For the qualitative analysis, the factors we consider depend on the event or issue we are evaluating, but could include: strategic impact; customer impact; competitive impact; alternatives, substitutions or replacements; legal or regulatory requirements; contractual requirements; or impact on strategic relationships.
Xilinx consistently reviews the latest technologies while tracking our major data trends from a water management perspective including implementation of the following Water Conservation projects that has significantly helped us reduce the amount of water consumed from a global perspective as shown below.  Weather-based irrigation controls  H2O Utilization Awareness Program  Strategic abandonment of landscape irrigation due to drought conditions  Low-flow fixture retrofits  Adoption of water conservation guidelines for food service operationsAdditionally, Xilinx uses limited water outside of operating our office spaces. Minimal R&D testing is performed at our key operational sites in San Jose and Singapore. Production testing is not conducted at any of our Xilinx offices.Xilinx's risk assessment and opportunity for improvement process covers how climate change factors are identified from the life cycle of our products at an asset level and then rolled into an overall tracking for improvement at the corporate level to set our annual targets and objectives. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is the process by which Xilinx anticipates the effects on the environment of its operational activities. If the likely effects are significant, relevant mitigation measures are taken to reduce or avoid those effects. Life cycle is also considered when determining environmental aspects. To facilitate this, Xilinx has established and implemented a system whereby: â€¢The environmental aspects (e.g. water risks) whether adverse or beneficial, wholly or partially resulting from activities, products and services that are under Xilinx's control and/or influence are identified. â€¢The significance of the environmental impacts is assessed to permit improvement objectives from a Corporate level along with the implementation of necessary control measures at an asset level based on identified prioritization. After identifying the environmental aspects and impacts (e.g. water risks), the significance of these aspects and impacts must be determined. The purpose of evaluating the significance of environmental aspects is to select a group of aspects that will become the focus of the EHS Management System, and for which Xilinx will implement operational controls and/or monitoring and measuring systems. The Site EHS Management Representative, in conjunction with the assessment team, will assign 'significance' to the environmental aspects for approval by the leadership team. Environmental aspects are rated with regard to the: â€¢Severity of associated impacts, â€¢Probability of occurrence, â€¢Potential impact to/of interested parties and â€¢Legal requirements This ranking system is a tool to help prioritize and highlight environmental aspects Xilinx focuses on.
Definition of substantive financial or strategic impact and whether the definition applies to direct operations, or supply chain, or both:Xylem defines a substantive financial impact as anything within our direct operations, supply chain, or value chain that stands to impact 4% or more of Xylem's overall annual revenue.The measure(s), metric(s) or indicator(s) used to identify substantive change, and threshold of change which indicates substantive change:Substantive change is identified through our comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program that has a corporate framework consisting of five key components: (1) Risk Appetite and Strategy, (2) Governance and Organization, (3) Policies and Procedures, (4) Risk Management Process, and (5) Monitoring and Reporting. Our Risk Management Process (4) includes a semi-annual Enterprise Risk Assessment, in which we identify, measure and categorize strategic, operational, financial and reputational risks in the Company and business segments that could impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives and impede our business resilience. Each risk is assigned a ranking of either primary or secondary. Risks are tracked on a Monitoring Dashboard that cascades primary and secondary risks and specifies who owns each risk. The dashboard denotes primary risks as high, moderate or minimal. Primary risks are updated quarterly to add new risks and determine how each primary risk's residual risk has changed (increase, decrease or no change).Every Xylem site is also responsible for developing and implementing a site-specific Business Continuity Plan, including as elements Crisis Management Plans and IT Disaster Recovery Plans. This process requires sites to evaluate change on a frequent basis and plan for situations that could have a substantive impact to our business. An analysis of water-related risks is included in the local Business Continuity Plans for all Xylem facilities. This proactive procedure helps Xylem to mitigate the risks posed by water, including water scarcity, flood occurrence, biodiversity, regulatory uncertainty and declining water quality.At least one example of substantive impact:A substantive impact within our direct operations would be any disruption to a facility that contributes 4% or more to Xylem's revenue (critical facilities). A substantive impact in our supply chain could be a sole-source supplier that can no longer make a critical part for Xylem's products, reducing our product sales by 4% or more.
The Board maintains overall responsibility for overseeing Yum's risk management, and delegates specific risk-related responsibilities to the Audit Committee and to the Management Planning and Development Committee. The Audit Committee discusses risk management during regular committee meetings and receives risk review reports covering significant areas of risk from senior managers responsible for these functional areas, as well as reports from the General Counsel, Internal Audit. The Audit Committee then provides a summary to the full board.The duties of VP of Global Citizenship and Sustainability include the representation of sustainability issues, such as water, on the Yum! risk committee. This senior level committee is responsible for the evaluation and as appropriate, reporting of possible corporate risk to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for inclusion in our public filings. This committee, which looks at short, medium and long-term risks, prioritizes risks based on a number of factors that impact the business including, but not limited to, financial, operational and reputational factors. More specifically, the size and scope of the potential impact are considered as are the possible duration, and whether the impact is likely to be a one-time occurrence or recurring in nature. We then consider the effect of the risk on business strategy given the risks and opportunities in both the short and long term. Therefore, water related risks, which are embodied at the restaurant and supply chain level, are incorporated into the Company's broader risk management process. For the current reporting cycle, CDP has requested information regarding risks that are substantive at the corporate level and not those at the facility or business unit level. As a global, decentralized, and franchise-focused organization with a diverse supply chain, many risks (such as water) can be important yet not rise to the provided benchmark of being financially or strategically important at a material, substantive level to the corporation. There is no single definition of what would rise to this level but for a corporation such as Yum!, a system impact (including our direct operations, supply chain, or both) of approximately 5% of net income for the annual reporting period could be considered substantive at the corporate level.

Abbott is committed to identifying and mitigating climate- and water- related risks that impact our operations, supply chain and distribution network. These risks include potential physical risks, as well as emerging transitional risks. Our integrated multidisciplinary company-wide risk management process assesses and manages climate-related risks at various levels of our company to ensure that our businesses and operations are resilient. Our policies, standards and programs drive business resilience and are regularly updated to align with current and future global requirements.Abbott's enterprise risk management (ERM) process identifies and evaluates the most critical risks to our business and provides guidance to our Board of Directors and management team. We have identified the increasing global focus and expectations to manage and mitigate environmental impacts as an enterprise risk for Abbott.Abbott's EHS governance teams and businesses also monitor emerging environmental trends and regulations to analyze their potential impact on Abbott, understand our risk exposures and develop appropriate management strategies. To calculate the financial implications of potential climate-related risks, Abbott's EHS and Economics organizations undertake scenario sensitivity risk-modeling analyses. Recent analyses have considered COP21 (global agreements on climate change), potential carbon taxes, water scarcity and impacts to agricultural supply chains.Abbott defines substantive change as any event which could impact our direct operations or supply chain to a degree that it would significantly interrupt product flow to our customers in any of the global markets that we serve. Through these processes, we have concluded that Abbott is not exposed to water-related risks that have potential to generate a substantive change in business operations, revenue or expenditure at a corporate level; however, we have determined that limited water-related risks exist at site and regional operation levels and throughout our supply chain. Through Abbott's diverse geographical distribution, the potential for climate-related acute physical risks to have a substantive impact on our business is significantly mitigated.The physical risks associated with water cannot be prevented, however we are prepared to mitigate the risks associated with these types of events. Through the work of our Business Continuity and Crisis Management, EHS, Engineering and Supply Chain groups, we identify and implement measures to ensure our business resilience. Our dedicated Crisis and Business Continuity organization addresses acute physical risks, such as unforeseen extreme weather events and changing precipitation patterns. Similarly, Abbott's Engineering and EHS policies and management standards consider chronic physical risks, such as water scarcity, and require sites to conduct regular risk and opportunity evaluations and implement mitigation strategies.To address water-related risks and ensure our business resilience, Abbott's Business Continuity and Crisis Management organization implements measures to ensure business continuity and minimize the financial impacts of physical water-related risks. Likewise, a core part of Abbott's business strategy includes reducing our water footprint in the communities in which we operate and engaging our value chain in strategic sourcing categories.Abbott's Global Technical Standard for water requires an annual assessment of water stress at all manufacturing locations. The WRI Aqueduct tools are used in concert to identify sites that are operating in water-stressed basins; both current and future water stress (through 2020, 2030 and 2040) is evaluated. Sites identified as operating in a water-stressed region are required to perform a more detailed local water risk analysis to characterize the degree of water risk, identify opportunities to reduce these risks and develop targets and goals. Potential water-related risks are also considered for new plant or site expansion projects. Local water concerns are evaluated as part of the site due diligence process.  Abbott also proactively identifies suppliers in high-risk industries, geographies and spend categories, conducting intensive screening in emerging markets. We assess sustainability risk through our Supplier Classification Model (SCM), which guides our Supplier Social Responsibility Program, and through the Supplier mapping risk matrix tool -- DHL Resilience 360, which has a Sustainability Index as a component of its wider risk index. Critical suppliers are then mapped against water stress using the WRI Aqueduct Tool. Through this process, we are able to identify which suppliers are more likely to have water-related risks that could have a substantive impact to allow us effective monitor and manage these accounts.
Any risk that, if realized, would result in a disruption to assure supply of our therapies and the inability to make a positive remarkable impact for our customers would also be considered a substantive financial and strategic business impact. In this light, the inability to access water or the scarcity of proper water purity (as an input to our processes) would represent such an impact.
At ADTRAN an Enterprise Risk Management is defined.
AMD defines substantive change to our business by using a screening process as follows for AMD's direct operations and key suppliers:1) identify sites indicated "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk using the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool2) cross check whether high risk sites are considered substantively strategic to AMD business and highly dependent on water availability3) determines whether high risk sites have appropriate contingency plans for sourcing water if local resources were not available4) if high risk and strategic sites do not have adequate contingency plans, then the risks posed from these sites can contribute to a substantive impact in our business.AMD is currently not aware of high water risk sites within our operations that could generate a substantive change in our business operations, revenue, or expenditures. But risks could arise in the future, namely due to the importance of freshwater use in our supply chain manufacturing operations.
Water supply for the heap leach operation at La India is crucial for the continued operation. We have alternative supplies but they may be affected by very dry years and only during the dry season.
Material impacts are generally defined as capital expenditures greater than $10,000,000, operating expense increases greater than $5,000,000 annually or strategic plan impacts of greater than $10,000,000. Additionally the 2018 year-to-date water compliance record of the company is nearly perfect and we have no concerns with meeting applicable water quality standards. Additionally, no new water quality standards have been proposed that represent a material risk to the company and would require additional controls greater than $10 million in capitalexpenditures.
With respect to water risk, a substantive impact would be defined as a percentage loss of network capacity and regional impact on network capacity, or a loss of water supply for a subset of our employee population (>5%) which would prevent them from working for more than a week.
we do not have water related risks and we lease our space so water is not in our control
A disruption to water supply that cannot be alternatively fulfilled could adversely affect the ability to produce aluminum sheet for use in the market. This disruption of delivery to key customers would likely have significant impact. Aleris considers it very unlikely to have a loss of adequate water supply.
Several Allergan locations have experienced droughts. Water is delivered into the areas from several other locations to supplement the demand from the area. Reuse of treated effluent to supplement existing groundwater resources has been instituted over the past four years in southern California. Plans for mandatory water curtailment and water rationing were developed for these sites. Water costs continue to climb as the resource becomes more restricted. There have been no impacts to Allergan product manufacturing nor revenues as a result of these droughts to date. The water cost increases have been minimal when compared to other utility costs such as electricity and fuel. However, in Brazil, electricity is tied to water availability due to the high reliance on hydroelectric power in the country. Droughts in Brazil do impact the electrical costs as well as the water costs, and are therefore more substantial.

Altria and its operating companies discuss Risk Factors posed to its operations and supply chain as federally required in financial reporting instruments such as our Form 10-K. Risks to Altria and its operating companies and supply chains regarding water and/or the environment include:-Natural or man-made disasters impacting one or more facilities or significant suppliers,-Significant changes in tobacco leaf prices, quality or availability driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns, and-Variations in Ste. Michelle's grape supply influenced by consumer demand for wine, industry-wide production levels as well as weather and crop conditions, influencing costs of production and pricing. These risks have the potential to influence operating costs for Altria Group's operating companies, and in the case of natural or man-made disasters; prolonged disruption in operations experienced by one or more of Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries. A change of this magnitude would be considered substantive â€“ the metric is increased operating costs and the threshold for discussion in financial reporting instruments such as our Form 10-K is based on both quantitative and qualitative factors.
Climate and water-related risks and opportunities are identified by numerous functions within the Company, including Corporate Social Responsibility, Ameren Missouri Power Operations. Energy Efficiency, Innovation & Corporate Strategy, and others through analysis, research and discussions by and among our different business segments. Once a potential risk/opportunity is identified that could have a financial impact greater than $1M or other qualitative impacts the company or an asset, a subject matter expert studies it. This threshold identifies potential substantive financial impact. Ameren's process for identifying risks and opportunities associated with water-related issues allows Ameren to make prudent decisions, while meeting customers' energy needs in a safe, reliable, efficient and environmentally responsible manner. We assess climate-related risks, including risks related to regulatory changes, changes in customer behavior, reputation, and weather. Short (from 0 to 5 years), medium (from 5 to 10 years), and long-term (from 10 to 30 years and beyond) risks are part of the identification, assessment, and management processes. The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) of Ameren's Board of Directors oversees our enterprise risk management (ERM) program. The goals of the ERM program are to enhance the ERM structure, further enable cross segment risk portfolio management, create solid ties to emergent risks, and incorporate detailed analysis of topical areas including environmental. Ameren's ARC meets at least five times per year.Current risk is related to implementation of water regulations through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program for our energy centers, new EPA regulations pertaining to Clean Water Act section 316(b) and Effluent Limitations Guidelines as well as future regulatory actions associated with threatened and endangered species and Clean Water Act section 316(a). If major capital expenditures or increases in operating costs are required at energy centers based on the final rules that would constitute a substantive change. This would apply to our direct operations as well as parts of our supply chain. We are taking actions to transition our generation fleet to cleaner and more diverse energy resources including renewable wind and solar energy, which do not need the large quantities of water compared to coal-fired energy centers, which will serve to reduce impacts of water-related regulations to the generation fleet.
We use the same thought process for risk. Does this pose a material risk to the corporation and define that impact as 1% of sales?
AEP's common stock is publicly traded and the company is subject to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition to its regularly filed financial reports, AEP is required to advise the SEC and the public within four business days of any event or development which would have a material impact on the companies. Generally these levels range between 5 to 15 percent of certain financial measures (revenues, assets, or income) based on the most recent audited financial statements for the affected company. Developments that have an impact equal to or in excess of the applicable threshold must be reported within four days to the SEC and publicly announced.
Currently, greatest financial risk is associated with climbing cost of water supply and water discharge treatment expenses. Water availability concerns will be assessed in the coming two years, though water stress conditions are being closely monitored in California and Lisbon locations.
Potable water is a necessary resource to our manufacturing process. Should water become extremely scarce in regions where we manufacture ourproducts, it could potentially have an impact on our manufacturing operations. This scarcity of potable water has been identified as a potential risk at a functional level withinEnvironment, Health, Safety, and Sustainability and is considered a low potential risk.
We define the following water risk that have a significant impact on our company's business, operation, product and sales.We consider sites with water risk as those that, are located in the areas with water shortage based on FAO Aquastat and whose overall water risk under WRI Aqueduct is medium to high risk (2~3).Amkor defines substantive impacts as those that have the potential to result in human loss, product loss, violations of regulations, and damages to corporate reputation.Threshold values used to determine whether there has been a substantive impact include occurrence of human injuries, violation of laws(fines, shutdown), and loss of product(<5% of product capacity and <1% total area of site)The definition applies only to direct operations. Our supply chain determines its risk based on its own business continuity plan.
We would consider a substantial risk for the business to be an impact which would affect a large number of our operations at the same time.This cannot happen, as our organisation is represented in many countries, river basins, and most of our operations do not rely on any other water than the WASH water.We estimate that not only does our business not depend significantly on water, but those sites that are more sensitive to water risks are not very many, and not strategic enough that we would be unable to assure continuity of the business from another site not affected.The magnitude, probability and frequency of the risks are low.
A substantive change is a significant modification or expansion in the scope or nature of Anadarko's direct operations (not suppliers) at a field level, as measured by the level of activity or production of an asset from sourcing, management or disposal of water. Anadarko has a deep portfolio of opportunities in the U.S. onshore, most of which would be considered unconventional resource plays. As such, these assets require access to water for drilling and completions operations. Without an adequate supply of water, Anadarko and/or its suppliers would need to develop alternatives, allocate capital to other assets in its portfolio, and/or consider reducing the level of activity in a given play. The threshold amount of change necessary will differ among operational plays based upon the economics involved with therequired change. These considerations are a significant part of our investment, engagement and water management strategies to ensure adequate supplies of and appropriate disposal of water at all of our U.S. onshore growth opportunities. Additionally, activity levels areevaluated continuously as part of our capital allocation process for each field. During this process, potential changes in operations and costs, including water availability, management and disposal, are considered.
We have an Enterprise Risk Council to oversee our enterprise risk management activities. The Enterprise Risk Council is comprised of members of our executive leadership team and the Chief Risk Officer. Roles and responsibilities of the Enterprise Risk Council include: â€¢ Drive an effective enterprise risk management culture; â€¢ Continually evaluate and bring forward emerging risk insight; â€¢ Review and approve risk tolerance levels (subject to Board review and approval where appropriate); â€¢ Act on risk tolerance breaches; â€¢ Engage with the Chief Audit Executive to ensure appropriate two-way communication regarding our enterprise risks; â€¢ Review the Master Audit Plan to ensure there is appropriate coverage of the highest risk areas; â€¢ Review and approve the evaluation and prioritization of enterprise risks; â€¢ Review enterprise action plans against risks; â€¢ Review and approve the policies and procedures for monitoring and mitigating enterprise risks, as well as any required regulatory filings; and â€¢ Review and support resource requirements (subject to Board review where appropriate).
At Applied Materials, we define substantive change as anything that could disrupt our business. Through our business continuity planning, risk management and supply chain teams, we are continually re-evaluating and prioritizing potential risks. For new projects, we have an ongoing project review process and look for a suitable ROI for any capital expenditure proposed. In the past, this has included some water efficiency projects or integrating water improvements into planned upgrades, as appropriate.Applied obtains most of its water from municipal water company providers, with the exception of our Kalispell, Montana site; which supplements its water needs using an on-site well. Our remaining facilities do not directly withdraw water from sources such as wells, lakes or rivers. No native water sources are affected by withdrawal of water reclamation processes or drainage. We recognize our role in conserving the quality of the bodies of water from which municipalities source water and into which they may eventually discharge treated waste water. Our water usage and discharges at our facilities are carefully monitored to confirm that they comply with local laws and regulations. Responsible water use also includes effective waste water management.An example of managing waste water, the Austin Industrial Waste Neutralization (IWN) Program, launched in September, 2015, has had a substantial impact on water usage through a water recycling initiative. In 2017, Applied Materials recognized a savings of approximately 3.8 million gallons of water and 5.7 million gallons in 2018.Prior to the IWN program, the Austin wet tool manufacturing operations tested waste distilled water and used reverse osmosis to neutralize the water and then discharged it to the City of Austin publicly-owned treatment works (POTW). The IWN reclamation program reuses treated industrial wastewater in the cooling towers at the Austin manufacturing facility as make-up water. Each gallon of reclaimed IWN waste water added to the cooling towers for make-up directly replaces potable water that would otherwise have been used. Excess volumes of reclaimed waste water continue to flow through the lift station to the City of Austin POTW. During the cooler months, the recycled wastewater provides over 90 percent of the total cooling tower make-up water and augments the original make-up water source during hotter months.The area where we have some of the most substantive risks is to the evolution of our products. We work closely with our clients to understand how water is influencing their purchasing decisions. In addition, we follow the best practices in tool development and specifications for water outlined in the SEMI industry requirements.
Generally, Aptar utilize a risk assessment matrix which measures the likelihood and consequence of each aspect and impact we identify. As part of the Aptar Production System, which measures and tracks each facility along a progression path, each facility is responsible to determine aspects and impacts of the business and then to prioritize these aspects and impacts. A similar risk assessment model is used during the comprehensive Risk Assessment which is performed annually by the Vice President, Treasury and Risk Management. At the moment Aptar is mapping water data from each plant thanks to the specific software module, the EHS&S of each site upload each month the total quantity of water withdrawal and discharged. Appropriate and detailed quantification of these substantive impacts are on-going considering also the use of WBCSD water tool. In relationship to the water risk assessment we identify substantive impact related to the use of water in our core processes as for example injection molding operations. The problem related to the water use and quality could effect our organization including operational, financial and strategic effects due to changes in the molding activities and scenario. For example if the water availability in a certain locations could be effected by a drastically reduction or scarcity this could generate problem related to the cooling of molded components used in the finished product. This situation at the same time could generate delays or problem in the planning for the production of finished products to the Aptar customers. We rate our risk based on a measure of probability versus severity. A substantial ("substantive change") risk would be one that:- has a high level of probability, meaning most key factors contributing to the risk are present. There may be deficiencies in controls or procedures currently in place. Historically, the event has occurred with some frequency within Aptar or the industry. The event is considered likely to occur once every 1-5 years.- has a high level of severity, meaning the potential impact on cash flow and earnings is material and will directly impact Aptar's ability to meet strategic business objectives.We rank probability and severity from 0 (low) - 10 (high). Per this heat map, a "substantive change" would be an item that:-has severity 3.5 - 6.5 and probability of 6.5 or greater;-has probability of 3.5 - 6.5 and severity of 6.5 or greater;-or has a severity and a probability of greater than 6.5
Risk Management Program OverviewARC has a risk management system in place to identify, assess and prioritize risks to impact on business. A risk matrix to help provide guidance for identifying overall risk and to ensure hazard controls selected will effectively eliminate the hazard or reduce residual risk to tolerable levels if the risk level falls under intolerable the risk must be eliminate or mitigated with engineering and or administrative controls to be lower to risk ranking of medium or less within specific time period. The assessment utilizes severity and frequency to determine risk level. Risks categorized within the High Risk level would be defined as substantive impact on ARC's business as in many cases it would result in financial loss $1MM or higher, from an environmental perspective the ranking would include short term impacts to groundwater or surface water with localized effects.Corporate ImpactGiven ARC's size and structure impact mentioned above would be considered corporate wide and not associated with a business unit. This would also apply to all levels of the supply and value chains as losses can be experienced in all aspect of the operation as the result is to likely impact ARC.Rating DefinitionAs mentioned ARC assesses the severity of a risk as well as its likelihood for occurrence, the severity is ranked from minor (<$100K impact) to Catastrophic (>$10MM). in terms of the substantive impact the severity would be listed as Serious ($1MM-$5MM). To have a serious event ranked as high risk there should have to be a frequency assess of "likely" to "highly likely" which could occur 10 to >25 times per year. As far as completing tasks are concerned ARC would not proceed with a high risk activity unless the level can be brought down medium or low risk through controls being implemented.All risks are monitored and reviewed annually ensuring all action plans (controls) are developed, assigned an owner, implemented and monitored for effectiveness.Example of Substantive ImpactAn example of this risk is the access to water. ARC is developing an area that the water demand will be increasing because of the frac sizes, etc. So securing water has become a key priority for ARC's operations. ARC has invested time and capital to secure water by building infrastructure that will bring decrease our freshwater usage and allow access to the produced water for our operations to continue. ARC's Parkland Water hub is operational as of Q4 2018 and it has been forecasted that ARC's Parkland capital operations will use 100% recycled water by 2020.
ADM defines substantive financial impact consistent with "material risks" as reported in its SEC filings.
A financial impact is any impact that has a direct cost of greater than 1 MM in financial impact, or can cause significant harm to the company brand or reputation. This evaluation is performed through a series of toll gates, usually through a compliance review or from a business unit review. This information is filtered through the corporate system to ensure proper evaluation and visibility. Success means that the potential for impact has been removed either through performance management, engineering controls, or capital construction(s).This applies to all direct operations and supply chain is not considered.There are no examples within this scope of facilities, but outside the scope, there was a water concern at a facility and capital was required to address the issue. The financial impacts were not above the threshold but company reputation may have been. Capital and engineering controls were implemented to address the concern and the situation was resolved.
Any increased operating costs, decreased margin costs and ability to build and ship our products is considered a substantive impact to our business.
Ashland defines a substantive financial impact as an expenditure combined or alone in excess of 1 million USD when identifying or assessing all potential risks, including water related risks.
Avaya considers a risk to be substantive if it has the potential to have a material legal, financial, operational, and/or reputational impact on our direct operations and/or supply chain. To determine whether an identified risk or opportunity is considered substantive, we compare its impact to Avaya's annual revenue and other related thresholds, which include: severity of legal and compliance ramifications (e.g. fines, penalties, lawsuits); impact on operating costs; the impact on our ability to successfully deliver products and services to our customers; potential for and length of service interruptions; and the amount of time needed to recover from reputational harm. Impacts are rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being ''insignificantâ€ (i.e. no press exposure, no regulatory or legal action, limited or no impact on customers, no impact on earnings) and 5 being ''catastrophicâ€ (i.e. significant reputational damage, criminal penalties and fines, potential sanctions, need to restate earnings). Based on this assessment, we map high priority risks, determine ownership of the risks, and work collaboratively to develop mitigation strategies and monitoring.An example of a substantive impact is service interruptions or delays caused by extreme weather events. Our cloud-based based solutions rely on uninterrupted connection to the Internet through data centers and networks. To provide such service for our customers in North America, we utilize data center hosting facilities located in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia and Washington. We also intend to serve other global customers from data center hosting facilities located in India, Japan and Singapore. We do not control the operation of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to service interruptions or damage from floods, earthquakes, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of these or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the ability to use our solutions efficiently or at all, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Avery Dennison defines substantive change as impacts on revenue, stakeholders and costs as well as availability of purchased goods. Indicators we recognize as having the potential to have a substantive impact include 5% revenue, concerns expressed by key stakeholders, and cost increases as much as 5% (or significant risk of material availability). Any one of these elements or a combination thereof would be basis for evaluating mitigating measures. These elements impact supply chain.
Definition of substantive financial impact:For CDP reporting, we consider risks and opportunities with potential financial implications for our business of over $10 million per year to be substantive. The metric used to identify substantive change is financial impact in USD. The threshold indicating substantive change is $10 million per year. This applies to our direct operations and supply chain.Example of substantive impact considered:With offices in Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, China and Australia, our Asian and Australian operations are vulnerable to an increase in the severity, duration and/or frequency of tropical storms experienced in these regions. Our operations in the southern and eastern United States, including our headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, are also vulnerable to an increase in the severity, duration and frequency of seasonal storms and potential for severe weather conditions. We operate 4,000+ U.S. retail financial centers, some of which are vulnerable to the physical impacts of climate risk with the potential to disrupt the accessibility of our retail outlets to our clients. Physical risks in the U.S. take the form of increased frequency and severity of storms with related flooding, particularly affecting the coastal southern and eastern states, and extreme heat events resulting in drought conditions and numerous wildfires across the West, Central and Southeast regions. This could lead to temporary, or in the event of severe damage, permanent closure of one of our financial centers. Physical climate risks in the U.S. are compounded by aging infrastructure, critical infrastructure dependencies, expanding urban areas in tornado zones, coastal population expansion, rising temperatures, precipitation and sea level rise and a lack of associated forward investment as highlighted in a November 2018 report by National Climate Assessment. Our U.S. operations experienced 61 Natural Disaster events related to hurricanes, tropical storms, flooding, wildfires, heavy snow and earthquakes in 2018. Our Asia Pacific and Latin America operations are also vulnerable to climate change impacts. There were 13 Natural Disaster events (tropical storms, typhoons and flooding) in these geographies in 2018. Climate change may contribute to less predictability around the types, timing and location of severe weather events, and we account for this in our business continuity planning.
Any water related risks with the potential to have an adverse effect on our products or revenue.
For the purposes of CDP reports, Legacy Barrick considered any long-term or medium-term deviation with an impact magnitude of greater than $200 M cash flow or 10% of the life of mine (LOM) key parameters (such as production rate, waste management, and increase in capital/operational cost), a substantive change to direct operations. Since 2016 our risk assessment process has become more robust and we since considered aspects beyond financials. Barrick will integrate the Former Randgold and Legacy Barrick systems to align and consolidate the management approaches for future reporting purposes.Mining operations generally require years of exploration, engineering design, environmental impact studies, permit applications and construction before operations commence. Once constructed, every operation follows a life-of-mine plan that schedules the annual production rate, waste management and environmental remediation etc. from operation to closure and post closure. We consider a wide range of risk factors in our corporate level risk monitoring and assessment, aligning strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge in order to evaluate and manage uncertainties the company faces.Risks were understood and evaluated using the Barrick qualitative risk analysis process, including cash flow impact, life-of-mine key parameters and license to operate components. Environmental risks could trigger water related consequences. BarrickÂ´s Water Conservation Standard required each operation and site to perform a water risk assessment on an annual basis. As part of this exercise, in 2015, the risk thresholds were reviewed in light of developments in the business to ensure they are meaningful, and amended as appropriate. Barrick also developed a comprehensive Water Management Framework to support assessment and mitigation of water related risks, including consideration of:- Water Location- Water Scarcity- Environmental Impacts to water- Regulatory compliance on water- Water Quality- Water Quantity- Water Management on Closure- Community perceptionFormer Randgold defined these impacts as in one of two ways:- Once off profit impact >$5,000,000- Recurring, annual profit impact > $2,000,000.Barrick will integrate the Former Randgold and Legacy Barrick systems to align and consolidate the management approaches for future management and reporting purposes.
Baxter defines substantive change in its business, operations, revenue or expenditure due to water risk as risks that could cause material adverse impacts in Baxter's business, operations, supply chain and financial conditions, or significantly affect Baxter's ability to produce or distribute product throught the supply chain. The financial impact would vary from site to site and will be directly correlated to the value of production of the site or sites. The water risk has impacted the decision to whether or not we could build a manufacturing plant in a water scarce area.
Water risks are considered as part of business continuity planning and uses threshold criteria established by that program. In the reporting year, no significant water risks have been identified. We continue to monitor water risk through regular activities performed by BD's Office of Global Sustainability. Any change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure that would prompt disclosure in other company filings (ex. 10-K) may be considered substantive for the purposes of CDP disclosures. This applies to both supply chain and direct operations. Examples of substantive risks considered include water scarcity, which has not exceeded these thresholds given the fact that water is not a key input into many of our products.
Question not applicable
Inability to manufacture product, either directly or indirectly (lack of water resources for staff and / or supply chain).
Bemis considers all aspects of economic, social and environmental factors in assessing impacts to its business. One example of what Bemis would consider to be substantive is if production at any one of Bemis' 50+ global manufacturing facilities were to be shut down as the result of a water related issue.
Specific to water-related risks, a substantive financial impact is any direct operations or supply chain issue that affects our profitability or financial position by more than $1,000,000.
A substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risks is defined as an unplanned disruption of the potable water supply and/or degradation of water quality for 1 hour or longer, which may be substantial enough to warrant shutting down portions/all of our manufacturing processes. As our manufacturing process is highly regimented, delays at any stage due to water shortage has the potential to require the entire batch to be discarded for quality and safety concerns. Additionally, some of our suppliers face similar constraints and substantial shutdowns for them could impact our material supplies, thus restricting our operations.
Water recycled and reused data were not materialized to BizLink's industrial nature.BizLink's manufacturing process is mainly in dry mix. It does not operate any water intensive process, and the major water demand is for plant facility operations (e.g. air conditioners, compressors etc) and employees' daily use.
Substantive operational risks are those with the potential to impede the Company from manufacturing or distributing product, and are considered possible, likely, more likely or highly likely in the short to long term future. Substantive risks are those that could have an impact on financial, operational, environmental health and safety matters, reputation and people.

Effective risk management allows Bristol-Myers Squibb to achieve our business objectives, generate value for our stakeholders and provide the highest quality biopharmaceutical products. We follow an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process that encompasses our entire company to identify, assess, prioritize and address major risks on an ongoing basis. Risk is defined as the potential for loss caused by an event (or series of events) that can adversely affect the achievement of BMS's objectives. ERM addresses the full spectrum of risks: market/environmental, compliance, legal, strategic, financial/operational and reputational.Our approach is a systematic and disciplined set of policies, processes and practices, as well as a structure that enables ongoing identification, assessment, and prioritization of the major risks associated with our key business objectives. Our approach includes developing, implementing and monitoring risk mitigation strategies in addition to reporting significant financial risks with probabilities to our management team and Board of Directors. The Senior Management Team receives a quarterly report on enterprise risks. Climate related risks have been elevated to the Senior Management team. Our Audit Committee periodically discusses with management company policies and guidelines regarding risk assessment and management, as well as major financial risk exposures and steps they have taken to monitor and control them.Substantive strategic impacts are considered risks or opportunities, which may have a significant impact on BMS and the potential for jeopardizing or restricting BMS's manufacturing or distribution of products that have a moderate to very high likelihood of occurring. All risks and opportunities disclosed meet the criteria for a substantive strategic impact but do not necessarily meet the criteria for a substantive financial risk. Doing business in a sustainable way is essential in developing and maintaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace and encourages innovative approaches to government regulation. We support open markets and maintain that real economic growth is necessary for creating the capacity to meet environmental challenges. We recognize that the integrity of natural systems - our land, water, air and biodiversity - is critical to both economic and environmental vitality.
Brown-Forman evaluates many variables in determining substantive change of our business and operations. One such variable is the overall availability of water for use in our direct operations. Globally, our company faces some direct risk associated with water scarcity because of the location of our operations and the requirements for water in our production processes and finished products. This risk stems from constraints on the available quantity, quality, and cost of water supplies across our enterprise but especially from a minority of our operations located in certain sensitive areas.Furthermore, a number of our key ingredients are agricultural based and are also dependent upon the availability of water. Any change in water dynamics, including water stress or even flooding, could cause supply disruptions or alterations in our supplier arrangements. This would result in cost increases for Brown-Forman. Also within our supply chain, we utilize co-packers for final completion of products. These facilities, while outside our operational control, rely upon abundant amounts of high quality water to carry out their services. Any disruption to their operations could impact the production and delivery of products.Weather, the effects of climate change, diseases, and other agricultural uncertainties that affect the mortality, health, yield, quality, or price of the various raw materials used in our products also present risks for our business, including in some cases potential impairment in the recorded value of our inventory. Changes in weather patterns or intensity can substantively disrupt our supply chain as well, which may affect production operations, insurance costs and coverage, as well as the timely delivery of our products to customers.Water is one of the major components of our products, so the quality and quantity of available water is important to our ability to operate our business. If droughts become more common or severe, or if our water supply were interrupted for other reasons, high-quality water could become scarce in some key production regions for our products, including Tennessee, Kentucky, California, Canada, and Mexico.
While Bunge has not defined a numerical threshold for what constitutes a substantive risk related to water, material impacts to the company's financial results may stem from three types of risk:  Our sugar production depends on the volume and sucrose content of the sugarcane that is supplied to us by third-party growers . Both sugarcane crop yields and sucrose content depend significantly on weather conditions, such as rainfall and prevailing temperatures. As such, unfavorable weather conditions have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our sugar operations.  Adverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, reduce demand for our fertilizer products and negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us.  Severe adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or flooding, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries and other loss and damage to us. Our direct operations and supply chain also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services. A disruption in transportation services, as a result of weather conditions or otherwise, may also significantly adversely impact our operations.
Question not applicable
Substantive financial or strategic impacts are those that would have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. In making this determination, we consider both qualitative or quantitative measures. The quantitative measures evaluated include potential impacts to revenue and earnings. Quantitative measures include consideration of impacts to employee/community safety, our reputation, business continuity and customers. Material impacts would include those that would have a high likelihood to result in death, serious breaches of legal and regulatory compliance, customer market disintegration, significant impact on shareholders, fundamental or catastrophic business continuity exposure and fundamental financial losses/ opportunities. The impacts we evaluate consider include those related to our direct operations as well as possible impacts to the continuity of our supply chain.We conduct an annual review to determine if there have been any changes that would affect the qualitative or quantitative impacts that we evaluate. If, for example, we believe the likelihood of an event has increased, that impact may now be considered substantive.As an example, increasing regulatory programs associated with greenhouse gas emissions and concerns regarding climate change could increase operational costs in the future and have a material impact on our business. On the topic of water, we recognize that a number of organizations and regulatory agencies have become increasingly focused on the issue of water scarcity and water quality, particularly in certain geographic regions. We are engaged in various activities to promote water conservation and wastewater recycling. At this time, the costs associated with these activities are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Financial or strategic impacts to business in the following area: general global downturn; technological improvement that would reduce need for CMC products; loss of major customer; competitor develops superior products; loss of intelluctual property; supplier disruption; risks to foreign operations; unforeseenegative impact of any merger or acquisition; cybersecurity threats to critical information; limited expertise and focus outside of CMP consumables; loss or unable to retain employee talent.
While Caesars works to identify and assess water-related risk on an ongoing basis, our primary procedure for identifying and assessing risk is through the completion of a robust bi-annual water risk assessment performed independently of other risks. Caesars identifies and assesses water-related risk across our direct operations and supply chain as part of CodeGreen, our environmental strategy. Our internal risk model combines output from credible and publicly available industry tools, WRI Aqueduct and Ecolab Water Risk Monetizer, with facility-level consumption data, to identify like likelihood and potential impact of water-related risk. In the context of a water-related risk, Caesars defines substantive impact as any situation or event with the potential to raise shareholder or customer concern for the sustainability of our business or the health and safety of our stakeholders and customers. Declining water quality, increased water stress and flooding have been identified as the most common water risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business. Caesars quantifies substantive impact at the corporate level at a threshold of $1M USD.The results of our bi-annual risk assessment indicate 7 facilities with the potential to have a substantive impact on our business, solely due to their geographic location. These 7 facilities are in areas where baseline water stress is equal to or greater than 40% and that withdraw from river basins where water depletion is equal to or greater than 75% on an inter-annual timescale. These 7 facilities pose a potential risk and impact to the sustainability of our business and the health and safety of our stakeholders and customers, because they meet our 40% baseline water stress and 75% water depletion thresholds. Our definition of substantive impact applies to our direct operations as well as our supply chain, and we consider the impact of water-related risk realized by our supply chain partners in our annual risk assessment. If one of our facilities either no longer meets the identified thresholds or a new facility is identified by meeting these thresholds, this would be considered a substantive change.In 2018, one of our high-risk facilities within Mississippi River Basin, Horseshoe Southern Indiana, was directly impacted by flooding and experienced a 7-day closure. This 7-day closure is one example of a substantive impact, as the financial impact to address displaced employees, emergency response, electrical infrastructure, increased insurance requirements, corrections to damage caused by flood waters and to re-sit the barge-based casino on land cost upward of $80M to complete.
A substantive impact is one that would cause a disruption to our manufacturing process and/or cause significant financial impacts.

CCL Industries defines a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business as risks to water that materially impact our business, operations, revenue or expenditure in a negative way for a significant period of time that would prevent us from carrying on normal operations and manufacturing activities to make and ship our products to customers. This includes risks in both direct operations and the supply chain. A substantive scenario could lead to reduced business in the mid-term, reduction in revenue, and increase expenditures to cope with realized risk time periods. As an example, CCL Industries would consider the loss of one of our top two largest customers, which together constitute over 8% of consolidated revenueas a result of an inability to innovate water conserving product solutions as a substantive financial or strategic impact.
Celestica has defined adverse material impacts in terms of our operations for known or perceived risks. In the event that inherent water-related risks are expected to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business, we would disclose them in our 20-F submissions at a corporate level if they met our materiality threshold.We have Business Continuity exercises where water issues are considered, such as flooding resulting in potable water issues. We also have scenarios whereby scarcity impacts are realized at a site operations level due to droughts or other local disruptions such as wildfires or water pollution. To date, disruptions have not had material adverse financial or strategic impacts on our operations.
As of the date of this response and for the sole purpose of this questionnaire and for no other purpose, a substantive financial or strategic impact resulting from climate change refers to risks and opportunities that are considered direct and meaningful and are likely to result in monetary costs or savings to Celgene. Potential substantive changes to Celgene's business and operations from water risks (see complete list below) are related to those that can contribute to a change in our business operations and impact costs related to water resources (withdrawal and discharge) and meeting regulatory requirements. The costs related to water resources primarily includes the costs associated with water withdrawal and discharge within operations. Costs can also be associated with regulatory fines and levies if any are made against our company in the future. This definition for substantive change is only applied to Celgene's direct operations and more specifically for freshwater water availability, quality and quantity which are vital for operations and employee consumption. Another definition that relates to Celgene's supply chain has yet to be formulated and applied.
Ciena's corporate climate change risk management process is part of a holistic approach to business continuity and business strategic planning. Ciena operates a third-party certified Business Continuity Management System which, through its multi-disciplinary functional representation, identifies business continuity risks (including climate change risks). This process also reviews business impact and enables implementation of mitigation plans to minimize impact to business operations, e.g. disruption from adverse weather conditions. This strategy is reviewed by senior management along with the business strategic planning which spans a longer time horizon. The Business Continuity Program includes reviews, exercises and recovery plans regarding emergency processes at the asset level. Examples of both programs include naturalhazards and their effect on operational sites including offices, labs, test and production assets, key personnel and supply chain assets.When it comes to BCP there are two approaches we take at Ciena. The first, an all hazards approach , occurs when there is a Declaration of Crisis, this crisis can be climate related. When the Declaration of Crisis is initiated, which is usually done by a Governmental body, a Ciena response team is formed. The Response team make up varies depending on the size of the impact and how the impact is coming. If it is a widespread crisis, a high-powered management team, staffed by Vice Presidents is formed.The objective is first to ensure the safety of the personnel of Ciena, and then to ensure the all-around ability of Ciena to continue its core competencies, and to protect the reputation, and assets of Ciena.Strategic impacts to our business, and those defined as substantive financially impacts are those that negatively impact Ciena in one of three ways, impacts the safety of our employees, our ability to continue our core competencies, and those that negatively impact our ability to protect our reputation.Climate-related risks are identified at the company level, as a risk to our productivity, if a climate-related risk will impact the ability of our employees to do their work. As well as, a risk to our reputation, if a climate related event disrupts our supply chain, making it difficult for Ciena to deliver our products to our customers, this will ultimately hurt our reputation.When there is a regional threat, for instance a hurricane there is another approach. When a Ciena facility is in the path of a hurricane, the BCP Leadership, Internal Communications, and Facilities for the site get together to devise a plan. To again, first to ensure the safety of the personnel of Ciena, and then to ensure the all-around ability of Ciena to continue its core competencies, and to protect the reputation, and assets of Ciena.As the hurricane travels and other Ciena sites are within its path, the process is replicated for each site.
Cisco defines substantive change as either affecting publicly reported financial results, changes to existing enterprise risk assessment results requiring mitigating action, or impacting component or product availability to the extent customer shipments or schedule are impacted. Cisco defines a substantive financial impact as anything that creates a penny a share impact or greater; i.e. greater than $50M in net income, or more than $200M in revenue. This definition applies to both our direct operations and supply chain and is reviewed and updated on an annual basis as part of Cisco's broader enterprise risk management (ERM) process conducted by Cisco's internal audit organization.Cisco has not identified any water-related substantive financial or strategic impacts on our business per our definition of substantive impact above. However, we have identified non-substantive water risks to our facilities, our employees, and the communities our employees ae a part of. For example, our Bangalore campus is reliant on water supplies delivered by tanker shipments controlled by third parties. Given complete reliance on tanks for water, our offices are susceptible to increased operating costs and supply disruptions. In addition, our Bangalore campus is a zero-discharge facility, which means we do not discharge any wastewater to third party municipalities or to the environment. To treat the water used on campus we have two sewage treatment plants that use filtration and reverse osmosis. All building water discharge is sent to these sewage plants for treatment and eventual reuse. 85% of the treated water is being consumed in HVAC systems (cooling towers) and for irrigation. Treated water for toilet flushing in two campus buildings. A negligible quantity of discharge water is trucked back to the water company when it can no longer be recycled. Water scarcity at our Bangalore operations are of significant concern to Cisco. As evidenced by our water efficiency and stewardship in that location. As mentioned, these risks could be problematic to our India operations but they would not have a substantive financial impact on Cisco's global business.
Clorox's Enterprise Risk Management Program evaluates risks associated with the Company based on a number of criteria, which include but are not limited to quantitative definitions such as cumulative impact to pre-tax earnings and shareholder impact from a share price/market capitalization volatility standpoint and other qualitative definitions such as reputation/brand equity, customer and consumer impact. For each of these criteria, Clorox's ERM program has established a 5 point scale from very low to very high and risks are evaluated across all the criteria/definitions. A substantive risk is one where the impact is medium to high across a number of criteria and has a high likelihood to disrupt our ability to operate our business.Clorox's systematic process for evaluating risks includes identifying risks, assessing exposures and quantifying the value at risk to the company. The evaluation considers level of potential impact, the overall vulnerability to an event based on the time and our capacity to react and adapt, and the likelihood of an occurrence. While severe regional weather events have the potential to disrupt our operations, or that of our customers and/or suppliers, we believe our dispersed supply chain affords us redundancy, which mitigates risk to our business from localized events. We believe the location of our facilities limit threats from rising ocean levels. Our global strategic sourcing function also has contingency plans in place to identify critical suppliers which may be impacted by extreme weather conditions with specific focus on areas of high water stress. Additionally, Clorox engages in engineering loss-prevention strategies aimed at reducing the risk of natural and accidental hazards and each location has backup power supply for critical functions. The company's manufacturing locations have comprehensive emergency response plans and most locations have business continuity plans. The company's headquarters also has an emergency response plan with trained floor wardens, established evacuation procedures and business continuity plans for critical functions.The Clorox Company is developing an enterprise wide framework and approach to prioritize local water risk issues and potential actions in all of the global regions in which we operate. In addition to understanding water-risk across our global operations, the use of tools allows us to identify water stressed areas and help direct our focus and resources to these geographies. This process includes screening all of our global locations using the Water Resource Institute's (WRI) Aqueduct tool. When referencing the Aqueduct tool, we evaluate sites located in high or extremely high water risk areas (baseline risk) for potential substantive impact. We plan to develop action plans going forward for all sites located in high risk areas.An example of areas we have evaluated for substantive impact would include the potential risk of disruption to our operations due to water related impacts. Sites that we have identified through the Aqueduct tool as being located in high risk areas are evaluated for potential production impact to the business in terms of each site's stat case production as a percent of total company stat case production. In addition, we evaluate the redundancy of our manufacturing operations to ensure that any interruption in operations could be mitigated by an increase in production at another facility which manufactures the same product lines.
Consumers Energy defines a substantive change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure for water risk as any change that would dramatically affect our operation reliability, costs or reputation. The definition applies to direct operations. Specific levels of change or numeric metrics of change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure for water are not established. Electricity markets are complex and based on many factors, including the relative cost of electricity within an established organization, often covering several states. The organization is approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to coordinate, control and monitor the use of the electric transmission system by utilities, generators and marketers. For the operations and facilities covered in this response, that organization is the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), Zone 7.
Definition of substantive financial/strategic impact and application: Our company evaluates matters on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business. As a U.S. public company, we always have in mind the Securities Exchange Commission's materiality standard, which does not have absolute dollar value or percentage thresholds. When evaluating particular matters, we would consider, among other factors, the size of the business units impacted; the size of the impact on those business units; whether the impact to the Company's business is continuing and whether the Company is able to offset such impact and the potential for shareholder or reputational impact. These considerations form our definition of substantive impact, which applies to both direct operations and our supply chain. Measures and Systems used to Identify Change:Colgate uses an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program to identify, assess, prioritize and manage physical risks. The ERM Committee is sponsored by Colgate's President and CEO and includes representation from key internal business leaders. Risks are collectively identified across the organization and are classified within the Strategic, Financial, Operational, Information Technology, Legal & Compliance and Emerging Risk Categories. Each Risk Category is assigned an owner who is also a member of the ERM Committee and who is ultimately accountable for successfully managing the identified risk. The Natural Disaster ERM - addresses the physical risks associated with water and climate change that could disrupt our commercial and supply chain operations. For purposes of this survey, we used a screening criteria to identify sites meeting the CDP guidance for "substantive" as follows: 1) sites indicated as "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk per WRI Aqueduct, and 2) which are either considered strategic sites or those which account for >2% of global production volume. Threshold or amount of change in the metric/measure/indicatorThis threshold that indicates substantive change is evaluated annually when the Aqueduct tool is used to evaluate water risk and is therefore variable. The Global Sustainability and EHS group engages with local sites to evaluate the threshold based on both the Aqueduct tool and more short-term and local conditions and events.Example of substantive impact considered:An example of substantive risks evaluated includes key supply disruption, such as if significant suppliers were to experience a business interruption that would result in decreased production capacity at strategic sites or those which account for >2% of global production volume. Colgate has a formal process to identify critical suppliers (e.g. high volume suppliers, suppliers of critical materials, non-substitutable formulas). Every year we update our segmentation strategies where we classify materials and suppliers according to the criticality of the material segment as well as the market complexity and buyer power using a matrix tool. Selected agricultural materials that are impacted by change in precipitation extremes and droughts are considered in this process. Risk management plans including changes in source of supply and potential alternative formulations are in place.

Water-related risks are particularly relevant to the food industry, with a global supply chain intensely dependent on the availability of clean water to grow ingredients. Managing water risk â€” both at our own facilities and those embedded in our supply chain â€” is critical to Conagra Brands' long-term business success. â€¯To determine whether these water-related risks have potential to generate a substantive change in our business operations, revenue or expenditures, Conagra Brands' Enterprise Risk Management team assesses quantitative and qualitative impacts. The risk analysis factors in both the probability of the risk and estimated financial implications. For this purpose, substantive impacts are defined as changes with the potential to prevent Conagra Brands from achieving its strategic objectives. Examples of substantive risks include impacts that could threaten any of our brands through production shut-down or inability to obtain raw materials for our products. For example, our Hunt'sÂ® tomato products rely on tomatoes sourced from California, where drought is a persistent risk. As disclosed on a quarterly earnings call, this brand generates approximately $450MM of our annual earnings.â€¯If water scarcity were to prevent access to tomatoes or compromise the ability of our processing plant to operate this would present a substantive financial impact on Conagra Brands' business. For financial reporting purposes, Conagra Brands applies the US Securities Exchange Commission materiality principles, where substantive impacts are defined as those that affect more than 5% of our revenue or assets, either in our direct operations or supply chain.
A substantive financial or strategic impact on our business is any impact that would materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. These impacts include, but are not limited to, factors such as coal price, quality, or characteristics, the demand for our coal, the operation of our major mining equipment with limited downtime, and our ability to obtain permits and licenses to conduct mining activities. The most significant risk factors to our business are outlined in detail in CONSOL Energy's Form 10-K on pages 6-7, available at www.sec.gov and www.consolenergy.com.
In defining substantive change to our business, operations, revenues or expenditures from water risk, Constellation considers both the magnitude of the potential loss, and the likelihood of the risk. For the purposes of this report, we define substantive change as the potential loss of 5% or more of our global production volume as well as the potential loss of 5% in each segment of our business (beer vs. wine & spirits). This percentage may vary slightly year to year. This metric includes only our direct Operations and not our supply chain. For example, a winery that accounts for 7% of our total global production volume would be considered to have a substantive impact as disruption to production or supply may have a material effect on our business.
If our water supply is affected negatively, this will impact our ability to make product and thereby meet our customer expectations.
As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and reported financial results. We are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support, and shared administrative service centers. Compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs. We are subject to both U.S. laws and local laws which, among other things, include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Noncompliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks. (CORNING INCORPORATED - 2017 Annual Report, pgs. 7&8)
Substantive risks are generally defined as having a financial impact greater than CND$250 million, though can be lower if the risk imposes significant harm to the environment, people or our company's reputation. This definition applies to our direct operations. For example, some of our operations employ hydraulic fracturing techniques to stimulate oil and natural gas production from unconventional geological formations. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of injecting proppant (sand) laden pressurized fracturing fluids into a well bore, creating cracks in the resource bearing rock. As the fracture closes, the proppant (sand) will hold open the new fracture(s) allowing oil and natural gas to flow more freely into the well bore. The primary component of the fracturing fluid is water (potable and/or non-potable). Without access to sufficient quantities of freshwater for these operations we would be required to reallocate development capital to other, less-water intensive operating areas, identify and develop alternative well completion techniques, or reduce production levels.
Cummins uses a multi-pronged approach to evaluate risks and opportunities and determining if they are substantive to our business. Cummins Business Continuity Planning function prioritizes and addresses key risks of which water related issues are one component. Cummins developed a cause and effect (C&E) matrix to prioritize sites combining multiple factors including: 1) site's self-assessment of water risk from a survey on source water sustainability, quality, discharge, regulatory, and cost considerations addressing both current and future conditions, 2) site size and complexity, 3) the presence or absence of water supply assessments, 4) and watershed-specific water stress indicators. For water stress indicators, Cummins worked with an external consultant to develop a composite picture of current and future water stress by combining data from WRI Aqueduct Tool, WBCSD Global Water Tool, and consultant expertise in the countries/regions where we operate. Portions of this data extend to a 2025 planning horizon. Scoring and weighting factors were applied to each of the 4 components of the C&E matrix and an â€˜at risk' threshold was defined as any sites scoring 150 or above in total composite score. Based on this, Cummins conducted detailed watershed assessments at each of the 3 locations scoring above the 150 â€˜at risk' threshold, recently we added two more sites. BFCEC due to its growth that raised the risk scoring and CBL due to specific water issues arising in the area. In addition to the watershed assessments over 24 site level audits have been conducted to further validate conditions at prioritized sites. These audits and assessments identified specific areas for water management improvements including conservation, risk management, and community/watershed engagement opportunities. Facility data and conditions are reviewed annually and may alter the priority sites from year to year. CMI has developed a risk scoring tool that utilizes risk and quality data available from Maplecroft. This risk tool is updated annually with all site scores, we use this analysis to determine site priority list, project prioritization and future goal development and conservation activities. CMI identified 264 critical suppliers. The water risk using the Maplecroft tool has been analyzed for each of these suppliers. Select suppliers will be required to submit a risk mitigation plan as a results of their scores. In addition to the six sigma project and the supplier engagement, CMI has developed a risk scoring tool that utilizes risk and quality data available from Maplecroft. This new tool will help assign a risk factor for each site that can be used when evaluating investment opportunities. It will also help in the evaluation of a supplier and new facility locations.
For the purposes of assessing climate/water risk for the CDP survey, what constitutes a substantive impact, can depend on several factors. In the context of climate-related issues and this disclosure, a substantive impact can be defined as a measurable financial impact that may be on the order of one or more percentage points of our company's annual net income, further evaluated against tempering factors. These factors may include the time horizon of the event occurring, the range of uncertainty of the magnitude of the impact, the likelihood of occurrence, and our ability to mitigate the risk.
No expressed monetary figure but generally the inability to access water necessary to clean/produce parts and provide a sanitary work environment are risks that should be accounted for in an assessment. As stated earlier, the water-related assessment has started using the WWF Water Risk Filter but more time is required to fully develop the model.

As stated in our 2018 fiscal year 10-K, John Deere's business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that impact agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment. This may include water related items such as timing and quantity of rainfall, excessive rain, flooding and drought conditions. Due to the variability and uncertainty of weather conditions affecting our customers globally, for the purposes of this CDP response we are focused on our direct operations, and the water risk attributes of water scarcity and volume. Usingthe WRI Aqueduct Tool, we define substantive change from water risk in terms of water scarcity and volume for those manufacturing operations currently sited in regions defined as having a baseline water stress of extremely high stress, high stress, and medium to high stress considering a projected change over 20 years. We also determine if these sites are considered strategic meaning they account for >2% of global production volume. If both criteria are met, then these sites could pose a substantive change in our business, operations or revenue.
Our substantive financial and strategic thresholds vary depending on the business unit, geographic region, the likelihood and magnitude of an impact at the enterprise and the individual business units' levels of tolerance. In this sense something that may be highly important at a regional or local level may not be so at the enterprise level. Each business unit has its own strategic objectives and to the extent that an event may impact the achievement of a business objective or that impedes that strategy from being completed at the BU, Regional or Corporate level, we will see that as substantive.Since our dependence on water is relatively low, and most of Dell Technologies' water withdrawals come from municipal water sources, we have historically prioritized efforts around water use in water stressed regions. Our assessments indicate that Dell Technologies' water risks may be associated with supply chain disruption caused by climate change and other water hazards. These disruptions may affect product or component availability and increase operations costs as alternative suppliers are utilized at greater costs, all of which may result in a financial impact for the organization in the future.
Question not applicable
There is no financial or strategic impact on the business.
Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)-related risks are considered on a day-to-day basis through existing, documented Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) programs and practices, which are discussed in detail in an annual internal workshop focused on EHS risks, stewardship and compliance. Additionally, an ERM annual survey of company leaders is conducted to gauge leaders' views, with various categories of risk scored for their financial impact, likelihood, time frame, and how well the company is prepared to deal with them. Devon's ERM framework helps ensure that the company is focused on the right enterprise-level risks, including EHS risks.Devon complies with applicable U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These rules cover guidance on the types of information a public oil and gas company should consider and disclose when preparing its financial filings, including disclosure regarding substantive or material financial impacts and risks. Devon's financial filings are intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future.
We publish material information about the Company's activities, including water-related risks, in official filings such as the Summary Annual Report and 10-K Annual Report. We define ''substantive financial or strategic impactâ€ to be any change in the determination of investors in buying, holding, and selling Dominion Energy securities. The metric or indicator of ''substantive changeâ€ is whether a reasonable investor would attach any importance to the impact in question. We set this threshold very conservatively; any change in impacts, ranging from low to high magnitudes, that a reasonable investor would attach importance to when considering Dominion securities would count as an issue with the potential to cause a substantive strategic impact. This is applicable primarily to our direct operations, though it can occasionally apply to our indirect operations as issues that affect Dominion Energy service areas.As an example of a considered, substantive water-related impact, our 2018 10-K Annual Report identifies severe storms, earthquakes, flooding and changes in water temperature and availability as having the potential to disrupt operation of company facilities, negatively impacting our direct operations and potentially being of importance to a reasonable investor. Dominion Energy considers information to be ''materialâ€ based on thresholds defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the companies' financial reporting.
One way that Dover defines a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business is an event or trend that could drive a significant positive or negative change in our sales revenue, pre-tax earnings, market position, competitive landscape or product innovation. Examples include innovative new products that would meet significant customer needs, or a sustained downturn in a key market that would reduce demand for our products and services. The assessment of risk includes consideration of the potential impact of the risk on our overall market position, competitive landscape, product innovation, sales revenue and pre-tax earnings as well as the likelihood and severity of the impact and mitigating controls in place.
Most of our operations and supply chain takes place in Michigan, which has an abundant fresh water supply. â€¯ The risks to our company are significant at this time, (e.g. as regulations continue to change and challenge our industry); however; DTE is mitigating these risks through transitioning its electricity generation fleet to less water intensive technologies, such as renewables and combined cycle natural gas. DTE defines substantive impact as a legislative, regulatory, or physical change in supply that would reduce our ability to withdraw the amount of water needed to produce adequate amount of electricity for our customers. Additionally, the definition extends to any financial and strategic impact that an investor would deem substantive, and DTE aims to maintain a reputation of sound risk assessment and management among its investors. For example, extreme weather conditions are identified as a risk in our 2018 10-K Annual Report, which we would consider a substantive financial or strategic impact if it caused damage to the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities. The 2019 Polar Vortex is an example of an event we would consider substantive. Damage to facilities due to cold weather impacts daily operations relating to water availability and usability. Recovering from these setbacks would result in increased costs from unforeseen maintenance to our power generation facilities to improve water usability, therefore negatively impacting the financial performance of the company. DTE does not define specific numerical thresholds for substantive water-related impact.
Duke Energy defines substantive financial and strategic impact as an impact that may impede a business unit from achieving corporate or operational objectives or business plan initiatives with a financial, performance, and/or reputational impact as follows:Financial Impact of:  Cost impact greater than $50 million in a 5-year period.Performance Impact of:  Governance council, EVP or cross-functional SVP intervention necessary  Negative regulatory outcomes including significant fines or penalties. Fines or penalties in excess of $5,000 are tracked against the performance standard.  Corporate Performance Measures on Reliability/Safety/Environmental below minimum performance level. As an example, the lack of sufficient cooling water would affect the performance measure for reliability. Any water related reportable environmental event (REE), such as missed reporting obligations, spills that reach waters of the State or U.S., would impact the environmental performance measure. For 2018, the minimum performance measure for REE was 44 or less.  Releases to the environment with a required remediation greater than 3 years and/or releases to the environment resulting in long-term impacts to plants, animals, and/or water bodies;  Severe regulatory actions with extensive recovery requiredReputational Impact of:  Major customer/investor inquiries (could result in downward pressure on stock price)  Active protests/picketing  National news exposure, such as a major storm failure, or significant spill.  Major backlash with follow-on implications from regulatory bodies, EPA, DOJ or criminal investigations.  Ongoing trust and reputation challenges with key stakeholders, such as local municipalities on water availability.   Continued negative national and local news coverage, such as a significant spill.Risks associated with these impacts are identified both internally and externally.
Eastman defines substantive change as one that would be â€˜material' information as defined by applicable law and thus requiring public disclosure to investors. This applies to both direct operations and to the supply chain.
There are 46 facilities within our water reporting boundary that scored High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) in the WRI Aqueduct Tool's measurement of Baseline Water Stress. While Baseline Water Stress is not a measurement of financial or strategic risk, this is an indicator of the percentage of our sites that have potential for risk. We are considering using Eco Lab's Water Risk Monetizer to calculate the financial and strategic risk of sites within our reporting boundary in the next two years. We have identified sites that are exposed to water risks, but at this time, through our Enterprise Risk Management process, we have not identified these potential risks as having strategic and financial impact on our businesses. Eaton management continuously monitors the material risks facing the company, including strategic, financial, operational, legal and compliance risks. Under the over-sight of the Board of Directors, risks/opportunities are assessed at the company level through a standardized enterprise risk management (''ERMâ€) process. Every business unit, every region and every corporate function participates in this formal process. Risks are measured using standard evaluation criteria. Results are consolidated and reviewed by senior leadership and presented to the Board. Through the ERM process and other standard procedures and practices , our business address issues associated with climate change and other environmental issues, including but not limited to customer requirements/issues (e.g., need for agricultural or water quality products to address water management regulations, consumer demands, profitability); operational issues (including new regulations and voluntary norms); and supply chain (including weather related disruptions influenced by climate change disruptions such as drought, flooding, water quality issues, etc.). Substantive change to the business, operations, revenue, or expenditure from water risk is defined as implications from water cost or availability that negatively affect operations, i.e. losing license to operate, inability to continue operations, significant increases in water bills or the cost to treat water.At the facility level, Eaton conducts strategic planning and risk analysis at all of its facilities and associated businesses. One of the factors considered involves potential environmental impacts to the business. Physical risks such as changing weather patterns, rising temperatures, intense storms/flooding and other natural disasters are reviewed. An outcome of these meetings is the development of local response plans designed to address these occurrences. For environmental and safety risks, issues planning, and prioritizing, Eaton uses MESH (Management of Environment, Safety, Security and Health), a globally deployed, unified system that consolidates all EHS and compliance programs and voluntary action into one integrated management system. Eaton facilities conduct self-assessments each year, and undergo a corporate MESH assessment and Operational Assessment led by independent internal teams every three years. Results are reported each year to Business operations leadership; EVP, EBS and Sustainability; and, where appropriate, the Board of Directors.
When assessing water risk in our direct manufacturing operations, we measure the impact on our total production volume (MT) to determine substantive impacts on the business. We define risks that have a â€˜substantive financial or strategic impact' as having a total (isolated or combined) >10% production capacity impact on Ecolab's annual total production in our direct manufacturing operations. For example, if one or more sites experienced a prolonged shutdown due to a loss of operating capacity which could affect greater than 10% of our global production capacity for a product line with no alternative production means, this would be considered as substantive impact. When assessing water risk in supply chain and more broadly across our corporate level Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, we define risks that have a â€˜substantive financial or strategic impact' as having an impact of greater than 5% of operating income, either as an isolated event or combination of factors that may impact our corporate strategy and business continuity. For example, if one or more of our suppliers experience a prolonged shutdown due to a loss of operating capacity and we were unable to source the same raw materials or the cost of which was equal to or greater than 5% of our operating income, this would be considered a substantive impact. This assessment and its criteria are reviewed annually and incorporated into our annual business risk assessment and reporting processes. Criteria that we consider in this assessment include, for example, the current baseline water stress as scored by the WRI Aqueduct tool, the future predicted change in baseline water stress using the IEA 450 climate scenario to 2030, and the business-as-usual IPCC RCP8.5 climate scenario to 2030.
Substantive financial or strategic impact on our business operations is defined, prioritized and managed through our enterprise risk management strategy. Due to confidentiality and public reporting restrictions, we are unable to publicly disclose our processes or calculated risks associated with water disruption potentials. With regards to water conservation and risks, Edwards is a very low user of water in its manufacturing processes. Therefore, very low or negligible financial or strategic impact affects Edwards operations.
We define a substantive financial and/or strategic impact as any water-related impact that results in material (+/- 5%) reduction or stoppage in production and/or (future) revenue at our sites, or a material financial cost to the Company relating to water sourcing, treatment and management. This definition applies to our direct operations.
In our direct operations and supply chains, bulk active ingredient manufacturing sites use the largest amounts of water followed by final dosage finishing sites. Packaging sites require very little water and present less risk to the organization. In our Global Supply Chain, we already take into account manufacturing issues that could shut down bulk active ingredient sites for 6 to 10 months, drug final dosage finishing manufacturing for 2 to 3 months and packaging for 1 to 2 months. We use inventory management practices as a primary risk mitigation strategy. An extreme weather stress event (i.e., a drought that provided a moratorium on water use for many months) would have to extend beyond these periods for there to be a substantial impact on Lilly. Our Global Supply Chain also works with our Treasury area and an external consultant to develop scenarios of "catastrophic" events (i.e., a manufacturing site being "destroyed"). We determined that a drought/water disruption scenario would have to extend for a long time (i.e., several years) to cause a substantive change to our business. Given these conditions and our product mix, we made a determination that extended periods of drought should not significantly impact our business. Costs associated with these analyses are embedded in operations budgets and are not disclosed.Lilly's Global Supply Chain and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) procedures have defined business risk parameters and financial thresholds built into their processes to evaluate the estimates of likelihood, potential impacts and/or relevance for stakeholders of business impacts. One example of substantive impact analysis that was considered was placement of a parenteral product (i.e., injectables) plant in a water stressed area. Simple mitigation plans were implemented as a result.
An impact that could affect both the day-to-day and long-term operations of the business. This could be a direct affect on facilities/operations or on our supply chain or customers.
Substantive impact is defined as impacting the economic viability of an operational area or facility, triggering a new evaluation of whether the facility is a net asset or liability. For instance, if the cash flows no longer exceed the anticipated abandonment or the cumulative positives are less than the book value (up front capital), there may be net loss.Metrics used to determine substantive impact include: proved reserves, annual production, net income, cashflow, fixed and variable operational costs, finding and development costs and capital efficiencies. These metrics are reviewed annually. Due to variable economic parameters, specific thresholds used to determine if substantive vary by operational area.Enerplus defines substantive applicable to direct operation only.One example of substantive impact considered would be the lack of economically viable fresh water for hydraulic operations. If regional water shortages led to surface water withdrawal curtailments, water may have to be purchased from alternative vendors at additional costs. At some tipping point the economics of the well might no longer make business sense. These evaluations are done throughout the project life cycle.
A substantive change from water risk would include impacts to operations or expenditures due to water availability or cost that would drive financial performance results for the year significantly outside the forecasted ranges (i.e. guidance).
For water resources, substantive change would be one that significantly impacts an operating asset located in an area of water risk as identified by the WRI Aqueduct global water risk tool, such as a cooling water system retrofit mandated by a permitting authority, or the potential for shareholder or customer concern or a combination resulting in a larger impact. The basis for expressing the percentage of operation affected is based on plants identified using WRI Aqueduct global water risk mapping plus our own plant specific information. The calculation is: total net generation MWh of the facilities located in water stress regions divided by the total net generation MWh produced by the generation facilities over which Exelon has operational control. This percentage does not include operations related to the marketing and distribution of energy or natural gas, which have less significant water uses. Exelon Corporation compiles an enterprise-wide inventory of water withdrawals and associated discharges annually. Exelon uses the WRI Aqueduct global water risk tool to screen for potential geographic water scarcity that may affect our operations or our supply chain . All facilities identified in the screening process as being potentially located in water scarce areas are further evaluated using internal company knowledge and regional basin management information to confirm the model output. The WRI Aqueduct global water risk tool uses twelve global maps grouped into physical, quantity, quality, regulatory and reputational risk. The seven physical quantity risks include: baseline water stress; inter-annual variability; seasonal variability; floods; drought severity; upstream storage and groundwater. Physical water quality risks include return flow ratio and upstream protected land. The three regulatory and reputational risks include media coverage, access to water and threatened amphibians. Overall water risk assessment identifies areas with higher exposure to these water-related risks and is an aggregated measure. In the past, Exelon used the UNEP water stress map which shows that Exelon has no operations in water stressed areas based on the UNEP definition (less than 1700 cubic meters per person per year). WRI's new Aqueduct assessment tool is more relevant in its definition of water stress, and therefore, identifies some areas where we operate that are subject to water stress as defined in the multivariate analyses in the WRI Aqueduct tool.
First Solar has an enterprise risk management process that includes identifying entity-level risks and opportunities via a forward-looking view (a three-year horizon). Risks are assessed based on likelihood and impact and residual risk, (i.e. remaining risk after action and control activities) is addressed to further mitigate risk. For the 2018 annual assessment, our definition for a substantive financial impact is a direct loss or opportunity cost of more than $50 million. Substantive strategic impacts on our business include a major impact on our strategy, major financial overrun, and/or failure to meet our key strategic goals. Our definition of substantive risk applies to both direct operations and our supply chain.Natural disasters such as floods and disruptions to our utility water supply that affect a plant's ability to produce and perform process development activities are water risks that could generate substantive change to our business. These risks would likely result in us losing some production for a while, until we are able to bring the affected buildings back to production. In this case, substantive risk is defined in terms of its impact on our overall production. Of the 2.7 GW produced in 2018, our manufacturing facility in Ohio represented approximately 13% while operations in Malaysia represented 82% and our operations in Vietnam represented 5%.In addition to manufacturing thin film solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, First Solar also develops, finances, engineers, constructs, and operates some of the world's largest PV power plants. The successful development and construction of solar energy generation facilities is contingent upon, securing necessary water rights for project construction and operation, among other things. Water shortages in regions where we develop and construct PV projects could adversely affect, delay and/or render the successful completion of a particular project infeasible.
Other than the ever-present potential for regulatory change, or the unlikely disruption of water sources, FirstEnergy has not identified any inherent water-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on its business.
Flex evaluates risks based on potential impact and likelihood. For CDP reporting purposes, we define a substantive financial impact for either operations or supply chain as one that could create a $10M charge to our statement of operations, resulting in a one to two penny per share negative impact. This also could significantly impact revenues unfavorably. For example, severe weather events may impact our factories and cause substantive losses due to business interruption and facility damage (e.g., 2017 Typhoon Hato in Southern China).Water-related risk to our operations is strictly due to interruption or curtailment or facility damage from severe storms or flooding, as opposed to water costs. Although most of our business processes do not depend on large quantities of water, we do require a sufficient supply in order to run our business. If our operations were to experience an event (in the form of an interruption) where we could not receive sufficient water, we could face significant limits to production. The more probable impacts would be to ancillary operations, e.g. dormitories housing our workers, as opposed to production. There are also potential impacts in our supply chain as some of those operations are more water intensive. We conduct an annual water risk assessment using WRI Aqueduct. In 2018, we concluded that our facilities that consume the largest percentage of water are not located in water stressed regions. As part of our annual water risk analysis, we evaluate locations that (1) are potentially exposed to high or extremely high risk to drought, flood or baseline water stress and (2) represent more than 3% of our global sales.
Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials due to water risk may adversely impact profitability of Flowers' direct operations.
We use an industry definition.
At a company level, FMC's Risk Council, Risk Management and Sustainability Group interact with FMC locations and functions on many issues, which can include climate change risks and opportunities. The Risk Council includes FMC executive leadership and is responsible for ensuring good risk governance, defining strategic risks, and monitoring risk assessment processes in strategic planning, business planning, capital planning and M&A. The Sustainability Group conducts an annual materiality assessment that quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes material issues. They conduct interviews with employees with a deep understanding of our business from Sustainability, Government Affairs, Internal Audit, Investor Relations, Communications, Finance, Legal, Operations, Safety and Environment/Remediation. They also conduct a survey asking internal and external stakeholders to rank material issues based on each issue's perceived impact on and importance to FMC. In 2018, the survey included 32 issues that fell into 5 categories: Operations, Workplace, Environment, Marketplace, and Community. Stakeholders scored each issue on 5 factors: financial impact and risk, regulatory and policy drivers, peer-based norms, stakeholder concerns and societal trends and opportunities for innovation. An issue that scores high on internal and external surveys is considered a material issue of high importance; high scoring issues are prioritized and considered for more research and/or stakeholder alignment. These surveys and stakeholder interviews inform our sustainability priorities, strategies, and reporting. The most material issues are reported in FMC's sustainability report. Among the high material issues reported in the 2018 Sustainability Report are environmental compliance, climate change, energy use, water use and waste. The 2018 survey had respondents representing non-government organizations, customers, suppliers, foundations, trade associations and employees. The most material issues were reported to FMC's executive leadership team, Sustainability Steering Committee, Board Sustainability Team and in our Sustainability Report. The Sustainability Group reports on the company's energy consumption, GHG emissions, water use and waste generation data. FMC obtained third-party assurance on its 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 data. FMC's sites collect and report this data to the Sustainability Group, ensuring FMC is able to measure its environmental impact. The Sustainability Group conducts water risk assessments, energy audits and social responsibility audits at FMC facilities and results are applied at other sites as needed. On an asset level, Risk Management conducts an annual risk assessment for our manufacturing sites and physical assets. It has a review process for potential natural catastrophes and possible sources of risks, which are generally disclosed in our 10-K. The Risk Management process has an Enterprise Risk Assessment component, which includes interviews of FMC's top leaders annually. FMC assesses risks using impact and likelihood definitions as previously defined by the Risk Council to arrive at ''enterpriseâ€ level risks, those estimated to have a financial impact of $50 million or more of EBIT. Based on this initial assessment, a preliminary report is presented to the Risk Council. After incorporating the Risk Council's input, enterprise risks are validated and the top risks prioritized in facilitated workshops with risk owners. These facilitated workshops use voting technology to find greater consensus on key risk impact, likelihood and owner. The final results are reported to the executive committee and Board each year.
We define substantive financial and strategic impact as a situation or circumstance which compromises our ability to manufacture and sell vehicles, which can include disruptions to Ford's manufacturing operations or our suppliers' manufacturing operations. Our analysis of Ford operations shows that some of our facilities are located in regions where water supplies are already scarce. Global climate change also has the potential to further impact the quality and availability of water. We cannot be certain that we will always have access to water of the quantity and quality that our operations require. Our water strategy puts primary emphasis on our plants located in areas of water scarcity.Ford is committed to conserving water and using it responsibly. We will address water challenges internally within our own operations and externally in communities where we operate and throughout our supply chain. We have committed to measureable actions to support our global water strategy.In deciding which facilities and which basins concern Ford, aggregate scores from the Global Water Tool (subwatershed level) were used alongside internal knowledge of specific facilities and local watersheds. If a facility had a high risk or projected risk by the tools, it was listed. The operating facilities listed as ''substantiveâ€ had to have a high stress or risk and have a production or support production of greater than 1% of global relevant production (vehicle, engines, or transmissions). This definition of risk applies to Ford's direct operations. For example, losing production at a Ford assembly plant, which would amount to greater than 1% of total vehicle production, would be a substantive financial and strategic impact on our business.For supply chain, we utilized the following methodology to determine water risks that could generate a potential impact to our supply chain. Suppliers are selected to participate in the CDP Supply Chain water questionnaire based on a combination of factors including those that supply water-intensive commodities, those with operations in water-stressed areas (as determined using the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and Maplecroft tool) and their business relationship with Ford. We repeat our assessment of selected suppliers in light of developments in these three areas on an annual basis. For this outreach, the threshold for "substantive" is if a supplier supplying greater than 0.1% of production spend has sites located in water stressed areas. In some cases, suppliers who fall below this general threshold may be selected for participation due to other potential risk factors. The ongoing data obtained through the CDP surveys has helped us identify ''hotspotsâ€ for GHG emissions and water use. These suppliers have been targeted to participate in the Partnership for a Cleaner Environment (PACE) program whereby Ford will share leading practices for water use reductions with these suppliers, work with them to set reduction targets and reduce our collective environmental footprint.For example, when we built the Sanand Assembly and Engine Plants in India, we recognized that this facility would be in a water-stressed area and that there was no municipal water supply available for employees. Lack of safe water for employees to drink was a substantive potential impact. Ford constructed a water bottling plant that treated and bottled water from the Narmada Canal so that employees would have safe water to drink. This project received one of Ford's 2015 President's Health and Safety Awards for "Excellence in Health".
Water risks are not assessed at this time.
Question not applicable
Substantive changes from water risks in our supply chain include those that could have a substantial impact on our business results incurring financial impacts; a threshold would be demonstrated by disclosure in our financial filings such as Form 10-K or causing reputation damage with key stakeholders.These could include disruptions in our ability to source products or increases in product costs due to risks such as water scarcity, quality, pollution, drought or flooding. An example of an impact that was not considered substantive, but could have the potential to be and is thus considered a risk at some of our operation locations, is extreme weather. We have, historically, had water related impacts to direct operations such as flooding and storm damage from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. These extreme weather events impacted individual retail stores, but did materially impact our business operations.Risk of water availability to our suppliers' operations could lead to significant delays in production as our suppliers' capacity is diminished, which could lead to lost sales for our business. Water-related impacts such as drought, storms or extensive flooding in agricultural regions where cotton is produced could substantially increase the cost of cotton, which is an essential raw material for our product, affecting our costs of goods sold. Historically, we have experienced substantive impacts from droughts in Pakistan impacting global cotton pricing and availability, raising our product costs and decreasing margins.Similarly, water-related impacts in regions where we manufacture may cause disruption or delay in our supply chain. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors' manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers' perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.They could also include reputation risks due to the impact of water-related risks that affect the well-being of the people who make our clothes or local communities. These reputation risks could adversely affect consumers' perceptions of our brands and lead to lower demand for our products.

We perform an ongoing assessment of a variety of risks impacting our business. As part of that process, we consider potential financial impacts over the near term and longer time horizons. Our risk analysis includes potential costs associated with increased or volatile commodity prices (and other related costs) resulting from water risks as well as risk of water supply restrictions to facilities. Risks are evaluated based on the total financial impact relative to the size of our business and the likelihood of those risks coming to fruition. For the purposes of this disclosure, substantive means an impact that would result in a significant impact to a key ingredient or key operation. Substantive risk for General Mills are risks that have high likelihood of occurrence and would impact greater than $50 millionto General Mills. A key ingredient is an ingredient that is geographically restricted such as almonds, dates or milk (due to the transportation cost) orits availability is controlled by local government and a key operation is one where we manufacturer a significant volume or sole source production of a product. A prime example of a supply chain key ingredient is almonds. With ~80% of the world's almond supply coming from California, a water related disruption to the almond supply in that state is a risk to some of General Mills' products. An example of a substantive risk that could affect our company is consumer perception and brand risk. Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences. If our reputation is affected, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Our annual sales in Fiscal 2018 were $15.7 billion USD. Even a small decline in sales (i.e. 0.01 percent) could result in a big impact. $15.7 billion multiplied by 0.01% equals $1.57 million USD. There are a few metrics we use to measure consumer perception and brand risk; consumer complaints is a key performance indicator and is monitored at least quarterly and periodic consumer insight engagements provide insight on perception and attitude toward our brands. The indicators provide actionable information to our business.Risks are considered as part of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. The ERM identifies risks to the company and its facilities (assets), plans mitigation activity, and provide reasonable assurance that the risks are being managed. The ERM covers the entire company including facilities, upstream (sourcing) and downstream (distribution and warehousing) supply chain, etc. Risks at the company level; The ERM Committee manages the process and promotes alignment between company's risk and Management's risk appetite. The process:1. Risks Identification â€“ input from senior leaders, business units, functions and facilities leveraging external perspectives and emerging risks2. Risk Response and Control Activity â€“ Business unit identification of risk mitigation activities. A key input to this process is our Global Sustainability and our Safety and Environment functions3. Reassessment â€“ ERM Committee reassess risk level and mitigation effectiveness4. Annual Risk Report â€“ report to Senior Management and Board of DirectorsOur risk analysis includes potential costs associated with increased or volatile commodity prices (and other related costs) resulting from water risks as well as risk of water supply restrictions to facilities. Risk is assessed using a three by three matrix using Low, Medium, High on the likelihood of the risk occurring over 10 years versus the impact of that risk in millions of dollars. The ERM Committee manages the process and promotes alignment between company's risk and Management's risk appetite.
For direct operations and in our supply chain, GM defines substantive change in its business to be when more than 20% of operating production could be impacted at a company level for ongoing operations (for example an impact to 2 million vehicles of production). The Chief Risk Officer of GM is our Chairman and CEO. The Risk Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing GM's management of enterprise-level risks. Additionally, during new construction planning, the site planning team considers inadequate water supply for direct operations to meet 100% design operating production volumes as a substantive risk.While the risks related to water at any individual GM facility are not substantive to GM in total, our operations in Mexico at San Luis Potosi were identified as substantive during the site planning phase because the non-renewable wells that are 600 meters deep were not adequate to supply high quality water in sufficient amounts to sustain plant WASH and operations. Therefore, corrective action plans were developed to mitigate the water risks and were implemented prior to the start of production. This included additional spending for water reuse to meet production water supply requirements and the installation of Zero Liquid Discharge to minimize the impact to GM's operations and the local community.For supply chain operations, GM has performed life cycle analysis of water consumption of all suppliers and used water consumption information to identify the top 100 suppliers by overall risk using WRI Aqueduct model. Although 4% showed high risk, our experience with current operations shows that there is not a substantive risk due to water for these suppliers.To engage these high risk and other strategic suppliers, GM joined CDP Water supply chain in 2014, continuing in 2018 and invited the high consumption suppliers with significant GM spend by to engage in water security management through CDP Water Supply Chain.
Question not applicable
We define a material financial risk as $400,000 or more.
In the context of the CDP Water response, Goodyear interprets a substantive financial or strategic impact as the inability to manufacture tires in accordance with Goodyear's long-term strategy. This relates to direct operations and the measure would include the prevention of growing production by one tire or more, meaning any growth prevented directly by water-related issues. This metric is reviewed annually as a part of the global water risk assessment and is included in the overall water risk assessment plans.
Graphic Packaging considers material financial impact to be at a level of 5% of assets, revenues or earnings. Strategic impacts include a loss of key alliances and customers, sustained serious loss in market share or company value. Considerations include long-term impact on reputation, litigation and/or regulatory/legislative, and whether the event requires engagement of the Executive Committee and Board.These factors are weighed against: (a) The proportion of business units affected; (b) The size of the impact on those business units, and (c) The potential for shareholder or customer concern. A substantive financial impact of relatively high magnitude could occur because of a large change in one of these aspects, or small changes in all three combining to create a larger impact. Forward looking metrics to define thresholds for the top strategic organizational risks are under-development.Graphic Packaging has identified specific Water Security related commitments that are included in our 2017 Sustainability and Social Responsibility Report and are focused on a reduction of the environmental impact of the organization. Our Vision 2025 goals include a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, nonrenewable energy use, water effluent at our mills, and collaborating with the AF&PA to achieve a 70% paper and paperboard recovery in the U.S. by 2020. Additional goals and implementation targets for waste diversion, safety, forest and wood-fiber certification, and social responsibility are also key programs for our Vision 2025.
Question not applicable
Substantive risks to our direct operations are those that impact our ability to successfully deliver products to our customers in a timely manner. Risks are prioritized based on severity and probability, allowing us to focus on those risks that are the most likely to have a considerable financial impact. We consider our insurance defined levels for loss of business in defining the threshold that indicates substantive change. Our production facilities monitor and report potential site-specific risks monthly, and company-wide assessments are completed annually. Each assessment follows a standard methodology that evaluates the frequency and severity of potential risks, including several water-related risks, such as sea level rise and flooding. These scores are ranked based on a scale of likelihood and severity, and the top potential risks make up management priorities for the upcoming period. Additionally, we work closely with our customers to understand their concerns and meet all risk mitigation requirements, including coordinating customer audits of relevant facilities.Unexpected events, including natural disasters and severe weather events at our facilities or those of our suppliers could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey and the resulting flooding disrupted our operations in Houston, TX, and we were required to shut down that facility for three days, at a total estimated cost of $50,000.
Substantive change is defined as change that could materially impact revenues, costs or the company's product/service portfolio. For example, by curtailing operations such as hydraulic fracturing, or by restricting access to a crucial supply chain input such as fresh water or guar.
HanesBrands defines substantive impact from water risk as a condition or set of conditions related to water supply that would result in the curtailment of production at one of its primary operating facilities to the extent that the company's ability to fulfill customer orders is materially impacted.
Question not applicable
Material impacts would be considered substantive.
What is your company's definition of substantive financial or strategic impact? HPE's ERM process, which is based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) enterprise risk management framework, defines substantive financial impact as 5% of operating profits. Any risk to the company's operations that exceeds the defined threshold is briefed to leadership including the Board of Directors and publically disclosed via SEC reporting. What are the measure(s), metric(s), or indicator(s) used to identify substantive change?The primary metric to identify substantive change is currency in the form of USD. Substantive financial impact could be from lost revenue, missed sales opportunities, increases in costs, and other financial liabilities. Other metrics, such as supply chain and/or logistics disruptions, are quantified by delay time, but ultimately translated into financial impact, which is then included in the ERM process and considered against the materiality threshold. What is the threshold or amount of change in the metric/measure/indicator which indicates substantive change?HPE goes through the process of identifying and measuring impacts to our business on a case-by-case basis. If the aggregated financial impact exceeds the materiality threshold of 5% of operating profits, then the impact is considered substantive and communicated. Does the definition apply to direct operations, or supply chain, or both?The evaluation of business impacts applies to all operations. This includes direct operations and supply chain. Provide at least on example of substantive impact considered. The repeated flooding at our Houston location, specifically Hurricane Harvey, created a strategic impact to our business operations which spurred HPE to move manufacturing out of a coastal location. And subsequently a search for a separate location for employees.
Definition of water risk-related substantive financial or strategic impact on our business: (1) Economic high risk: based on current or future negative financial impacts and potential for negative impact on regional operations or guest experience. (2) Environmental high risk: based on potential for legal non-compliance or negative cost impacts through remediation or recovery efforts. (3) Social high risk: based on potential negative impact on brand, reputation and stakeholder relationships as well as potential for legal non-compliance. Using the WWF Water Risk Filter, we align and evaluate the factors that may potentially impact our current global hotel operations and expansion in specific geographic markets. We also seek to identify specific areas and river basins where Hilton's water stewardship initiatives and engagement would have the greatest value. Measures used to identify substantive change: In our screening of hotels for further analysis and potential inclusion, we initially consider those hotels with an overall WWF basin risk of 3.5 or greater (med high to high). We then evaluate all hotels (managed/direct operations and franchised/value chain) within that river basin over other key risk indicators to determine the primary driver within each basin and to identify priority areas for collective action:(1) Economic high risk is aligned with WWF Physical Risk indicators(2) Environmental high risk is aligned with Regulatory Risk indicators(3) Social high risk is aligned with Reputation Risk indicatorsThreshold indicating a substantive change: Typically, the primary risk type and risk driver will have an average basin risk of at least 4.0. We consider any scores greater than 3.5 to be substantive.Application: The above definition applies to our direct operations and our supply chain.
Substantive financial or strategic impact is defined as 1) an extremely high risk ranking as determined by the internal water-risk review process or 2) water risk with financial impacts exceeding levels established by the internal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process (scoring and ranking is reviewed and updated annually).
At the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) level, our definition of substantive financial impact for all risks considered including environmental risks aligns with our ERM threshold principles which consider the impact as a certain percentage of operating profit. At the functional level, substantive financial and strategic impact is viewed in the context more specific to the business function, mandate, and operating budget. For our global operations, HP Corporate Real Estate and Workplace Solutions team gauges impact based on risk thresholds and change in costs. For example, a water rate increase of 10% or more is considered substantive for CREWS operating budgets in our direct operations costs. Flood risk is another water risk with substantive impact to our facilities. For risk thresholds, we use the WRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool to assess potential substantive changes and impact in our business and operations due to water stress. HP defines substantive impact from water risk in our operations as facilities that are downgraded to either scarce or extremely scarce renewable water supply per person as defined by the WRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool. For example, in 2018, 22% more HP sites than in 2017 were upgraded based on their level of water risk exposure. Our threshold is when a facility moves from sufficient water supply to stressed status. This applies to all HP operations globally. We apply a similar methodology to our supply chain. For our indirect operations/supply chain, we also gauge substantive impact based on increase in our suppliers' operating costs or potential or actual disruption of product or critical part supply due to water cost, quality or scarcity. Depending on the product and its current inventory, delays in production of, e.g., 1 week or more could significantly impact order fulfillment and product delivery, putting revenue at risk. Such disruptions due to water (other than floods) have not been experienced in our supply chain to a degree that a specific threshold of change has been established. Stakeholder concerns and reputation are two important but more qualitative gauges of substantial strategic impact for both water-related issues in our direct operations and indirect operations/supply chain. The threat or occurrence of negative press or an NGO campaign exposes the company to brand damage. A ''headlineâ€ test is applied internally to evaluate how an issue or action will affect brand perception and the business overall.
Hudbay Minerals identifies substantive change as a significant impact on the economics of a project or operation that would result in a substantial additional capital investment or a significant deterioration in the financial return on an existing investment.
Husky's enterprise risk management program supports decision-making via comprehensive and systematic identification and assessment of risks that could materially impact the Company's results. Through this framework, the Company builds risk management and mitigation into strategic planning and operational processes for its business units through the adoption of standards and best practices. Husky has developed an enterprise risk matrix to identify risks to its people, the environment, its assets and its reputation, and to systematically mitigate these risks to an acceptable level. Husky defines substantive change as a financial impact to direct operations of greater than $10 million dollars. The corporate risk register is revisited on at least an annual basis, while the matrix is evaluated every three years.
We would consider a substantive risk to exist only where any of our businesses changed their operations, sources of supply or customer base due to water related matters and such change in any one of our seven business segments was considered significant by that segment or ITW overall.
Substantive impacts would disrupt our ability to deliver products or services to our customers, interfere with meeting the needs of our staff or raise our operating budget by a significant percentage.
We define substantive site-level water risks as any facility (direct operation) meeting all of the following criteria:1. Site is identified as being High or Extremely High risk utilizing our ensemble risk tool methodology;2. Site accounts for >5% of our global production by volume; and3. Site is considered strategic to the growth strategy of the organization.Sites are evaluated against these criteria annually to determine if they meet this definition, indicating a potentially substantive impact.In addition to site level impacts, our Business Continuity Plan (BCP) risk assessment process considers supply chain impacts, including lack of raw material availability (primarily agriculture). The BCP risk a combination of: (1) the probability or likelihood that a consequence/ impact will occur; (2) the severity of the consequences if the impact occurs; and, (3) the strength of the controls in place. Substantive risks would include those that have the potential to impact production and ability to meet commitments to our customers.We have also begun evaluating our suppliers by mapping locations in the WWF Water Risk Filter to determine if any are located in areas having annual average monthly net water depletion equal to or greater than 75%, or seasonal water depletion equal to or greater than 75% (one or months).An example of a substantive impact would be a strategic facility (e.g., site that accounts for >5% of our global production by volume) needing to curtail production due to lack of water or agricultural raw material availability. In our environmental management system, we define disruption to operations of greater than seven days as high severity. The current probability of this occurring is ranked as unlikely (i.e., has not occurred or may be anticipated to occur less than once/year). This would also result in an impact to our customers if we were to be unable to supply product to them.
Interruption of business activities where employees are not able to perform work at current location, relocation of assets (people, equipment, etc.), and inability to maintain contract obligations to customers.
Intel's Board of Directors and management consider ''riskâ€ for these purposes to be the possibility that an undesired event could occur that might adversely affect the achievement of our objectives and would be relevant to the decision making of investors and users of our financial reporting. The types of risks include: â€¢ Macro-economic risks such as inflation, reductions in economic growth, or recession â€¢ Political risks such as restrictions on access to markets, confiscatory taxation, and expropriation of assets â€¢ Physical risks such as natural disasters (e.g., floods, prolonged drought, etc.) â€¢ Business-specific risks related to strategy and competition, product demand, global operations, manufacturing, cybersecurity and privacy, intellectual property, litigation and regulatory compliance, corporate responsibility and sustainability, corporate governance, and environmental stewardship. Our internal teams also monitor and evaluate reputational risks, such as the community's perception of how we manage our water, particularly in times of prolonged drought, as well as regulatory risks, such as changing regulations that could limit the amount of water used or increase our costs related to water usage. We define a "substantive change" related to water-risk as a change that would impact or influence our business (output or revenue). This is actively monitored by dedicated teams and is measured through various indicators such as interpretation of public perception (Global Public Affairs team), potential for any water disruption (Global Supply Management team), potential for legal costs (Global Public Affairs and Sustainability or EHS Legal Team), or any noticeable impact on our business (revenue impacts or the inability to work in certain areas of the world). The thresholds we use to determine if something would be considered a substantive change include any impacts to production capabilities or resulting revenues, damages to our public image, and changing regulations that would limit our ability for growth or incur a significant cost (e.g., regulations driving increased water-related costs that could increase operating costs by several million dollars per site). These criteria apply to our direct operations as well as our ability to continue working with our major suppliers.
IBM's enterprise risk management process considers relevant risks to our business including those related to the environmental and climate change and helps ensure business continuity and asset protection. In addition, our global EMS includes a process for identifying and assessing significant environmental aspects of our business. Potential environmental risks include extreme weather events, interruptions in the availability of energy, water and other critical materials, which could cause short-term disruptions to IBM's operations or supply chain; inability to comply with environmental laws and regulations, which could impact manufacturing operations or product deliveries; liabilities associated with inadequate or improper disposal of wastes and other materials generated from operations, including end-of-life products; and impacts to our reputation associated with perceived failure to responsibly manage the environmental impacts of our operations. IBM manages its operations to meet business objectives while minimizing these potential risks. Our senior leaders assess and manage these risks and provide regular updates to the Directors and Corporate Governance Committee. Our EMS establishes responsibilities for identifying and complying with environmental laws and regulations â€” responsibilities that are also specified in our environmental requirements for suppliers, as well as the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines certification that all IBMers must complete annually.IBM manages its operations to meet business objectives while minimizing these potential risks. Our senior leaders assess and manage these risks and provide regular updates to the Directors and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board. Our EMS also addresses responsibilities for identifying and complying with environmental laws and regulations â€” responsibilities that are also addressed in our environmental requirements for suppliers, as well as the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines certification that all IBMers must complete annually.IBM does not perceive any unusual or substantive water-related impacts on our operations or the value chain outside of those risks we plan for as part of our ongoing business and risk management processes. These processes look at business risk comprehensively including, but not limited to, risks and impacts related to water use and wastewater discharges. We anticipate that the business model of both IBM's and our production and service suppliers' operations will enable those operations to anticipate and adapt to potential risks and mitigate the impacts without significant disruptions to our business. Refer to: https://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/ems/
We define substantive financial or strategic impact when identifying or assessing water-related risks in both our direct operations and our supply chain as any change that would significantly affect our business, operations, revenue or expenditure.For our direct operations, we use the overall water risk as defined by WRI Aqueduct Tool as the metric to identify water-related risks that could cause â€˜substantive' change in our business, operations, revenue or expenditure. The threshold that indicates â€˜substantive change' are areas labeled as ''Highâ€ or ''Extremely Highâ€ by the Aqueduct tool for our strategic sites. Our strategic sites are those that are critical to operations such as our manufacturing facilities or corporate headquarters. Each site is reviewed annually through WRI Aqueduct and assessed in terms of overall water risk, business growth and strategy. To date, we have not identified a water-related risk for our strategic sites which could cause a substantive change in our business. For example, one substantive impact considered by the tool is the physical risk quantity which assesses reliable access to enough water to maintain operations.In our value chain, water quality and water quantity are important to our supply chain. We measure substantive impact in our supply chain using an internal risk scorecard that incorporates multiple environmental datasets, including the Yale Environmental Performance Index (EPI), which ranks 180 countries on 24 performance indicators across ten issue categories covering environmental health and ecosystem vitality. The result is a risk score measured as high, medium or low, with a change from low to high indicating â€˜substantive change.' This assessment is updated and metrics are reviewed on a bi-annual basis by the Yale EPI and then updated into our program accordingly.One example of a substantive supply-chain impact considered is the risk of reduced or disrupted raw material availability caused by precipitation extremes and droughts. Over the past several years, changes in precipitation extremes and droughts in Brazil, Madagascar, and Florida, USA, have affected the availability and cost of our key natural ingredients, such as orange oil and vanilla.

Risk can be viewed as the combination of the probability of an event and the impact of its consequences. Events with a negative impact represent risks that can prevent value creation or erode existing value. Generally, risks to the Company's success can be grouped into four categories: (1) Strategic, (2) Operational, (3) Compliance and (4) Financial and Reporting. Climate change risks generally fall in the area of strategic, operational and compliance. Risks and opportunities are prioritized by their relative magnitude and the timeframe in which the risks/opportunity may present itself, as well as our overall ability to control or influence the situation. Risks are rated by impact (from negligible to moderate) and likelihood (remote to highly likely) based on impact on the business (demand, cost, etc) and Trustmark. This definition applies to direct operations and supply chain.Substantive strategic impacts are disclosed in this report, which are risks / opportunities with a meaningful impact to J&J's Trustmark, potential for action that could impede J&J from manufacturing or distributing some product volume. The threshold for what is substantive is based on probability, where the risk is considered possible, likely, more likely or highly likely in the short to long term future. All risks and opportunities disclosed meet the criteria for a substantive strategic impact but do not meet the criteria for a substantive financial risk for the purposes of this report. For example, the drought in Cape Town, South Africa in 2017 qualified as a substantive risk, even though there was no impact to production, because there was a â€˜highly likely' probability of water shortages for that facility where one or more product lines for one or more countries could be affected.
We define substantive as having a material financial impact on the entire enterprise. Although some facilities may be subject to water risks, such risks at the enterprise level are not financially material. Also water was not one of the top-ranked issues in our sustainability survey. At the same time, we see a growing opportunity for us to continue to innovate products and services that help our customers be more resource efficient, including reducing water consumption.
A risk management working team is maintained to assess and report overall strategic and operational risks found in our operations and supply chain. When risks hit certain material thresholds or causes substantive change, the committee reports those risks to company management and the board of directors.Juniper prioritizes risks that are found to be material. Materiality of an issue is assessed as follows:â€¢ The risk of the climate issue to business operations: Using our corporatestrategy, Juniper looks at whether the issue represents a significant risk to our company or industry? Is it current or emerging? Is it already part of the Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability (CCS) strategy or does it need to be added?â€¢ The priority of the issue to our stakeholders: Does this issue resonate with our key stakeholders? Is it a subject of NGO campaigns? How does it track in the media? Is it reflected in pending legislation, regulations, or international agreements? Is it aligned with topics identified as material in regular materiality assessments?â€¢ Peers and competitors: Do Juniper's peers and competitors disclose against this issue? How do they respond?â€¢ Juniper's influence over the issue: To what extent does Juniper have control or influence over the issue through our direct actions, industryassociations, or networks?â€¢ Relevant and applicable voluntary global reporting and CCS standards and guidelines: Is the issue addressed by the standard disclosures of the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines, Responsible Business Alliance Code of Conduct, or by other relevant and applicable global voluntary standards?Juniper's approach to materiality is aligned with the domain solutions and customer verticals of our business strategy. The strategy provides astructure and hierarchy for prioritizing the value, or risk, of an issue on Juniper's business operations. It is based on the following approach: Is this issue critical to our customer segments (Cloud, Telecom/Cable, and Strategic Enterprise)? Is this issue relevant to our product domains (Campus & Branch, Access & Aggregation, Edge, Core, Data Center, and CloudServices)? Risks found to be material are then acted on through various management methods.Innovation inherently carries risks associated with developing and bringing products to market. However, Juniper utilizes the company's ERM framework and its quantitative thresholds to determine our tolerance and exposure to risk and potential for financial impact. This framework, and subsequently the outcomes of it, are aligned with the assessment of an issue's materiality, as described above. There are a multitude of factors that help determine an issue's level of financial impact or risk. From a qualitative perspective, examples are below.An example of substantial financial impact may be due to exposure in our downstream sales. If we fail to anticipate market requirements or opportunities or fail to develop and introduce new products, product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner then this could cause us to lose customers, and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Another example of substantial financial impact is the risk factors Juniper considers may impact our stock price. Juniper discloses these risk factors in our annual 10-K report, where we also discuss our exposure to financial risk. Some examples of material risk that Juniper considers financially impactful are changes in tax laws or accounting rules, our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions, and success in new and evolving markets and emerging technologies.
Kellogg defines substantive change as including but not limited to plant relocation, curtailment of operations, product relocation, interruptions in availability, increased cost for municipal water, increased cost for raw materials, lack of security of supply of raw materials, and significant investment in water reduction/recycling that are likely to happen. The metrics for this would include increased costs, lack of availability causing shut downs, and increased water treatment. The threshold for these indicators would vary from facility to facility but would be assessed against profit and loss and operational budgets. This covers both operations and supply chain.
Risks that could impact production levels and/or or profitability are considered substantive. Risks that could have a significant negative effect on our brand are considered substantive.
KDP defines a water related 'substantive' impact at the corporate level as a risk that could cause material financial change to our business. This definition is inclusive of direct and indirect impacts to operations, services and our supply chain. This distinction is in line with other KDP ERM risk assessment and audit processes. An impact that constitutes a water related substantive change could accumulate through any or a combination of the following:  Frequency of impact - a single or multiple occurrence over a 10-year time horizon.   Disruption to production - at our manufacturing or distribution facilities as well as facilities of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers or distributors.  U.S. and international laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.  Weather, natural disasters, climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business.  Costs and supply for commodities, such as raw materials and energy, may change substantially and shortages may occur.  Damage to our reputation - Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.Good decisions about water resources happen at a local level and take into account water availability and community water needs. We use the Ecolab Water Risk Monetizer and the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas to evaluate water risk in our operating footprint and supply chain.An example of substantive change could be a one-time flooding event that requires the closure of our plant that manufactures almost all our beverage concentrates. This impact could surpass a substantive magnitude and/or create strategic change to our business. Beverage concentrates made up 12% of our 2018 net sales and our concentrate plant supplies critical ingredients to some of our packaged beverages facilities that made up another 46% of our 2018 net sales.
Question not applicable
More than 30% decrease in plant production output or revenue, or 30% increase in operating cost expenditure due to insufficient water supply or increased cost of water supply.
Drought or floods could cause interruptions to our ability to operate or to our supply chain depending upon where the incident is and when in the build cycle we are. Some suppliers are in flood zones and have to maintain addition Business Continuity measures.

Question not applicable
Kohler defines substantive financial or strategic impact as anything that is likely to cause a disruption to business as usual, revenue, market share, or the workforce.Several of Kohler's manufacturing locations are in regions/watersheds that experience periodic stress. Our work on water risk will serve to justify additional investment in water reuse projects at these locations to reduce their need to draw from local sources. Of a larger concern is that Kohler's plumbing products require water to function and/or deliver the utility that consumers need in their homes and businesses. We sell products globally and, in areas where water is scarce or becoming more expensive, there is a risk that fixtures that use water will be restricted by codes or not used properly leading to health impacts. We're developing water treatment and reuse technologies designed for residential and light commercial application. A parallel concern is water quality. We offer a variety of filtration technologies that can remove most contaminants and we continue to build out this portion of our product line.
Kroger uses multiple mechanisms and processes for identifying and assessing risks at a company-level. Kroger evaluates identified business risks through multiple lenses, such as impact to financial performance, business continuity, regulatory and legal compliance and corporate citizenship and reputation. Kroger puts the customer at the center of everything we do as a company, which is why financial impacts as well as reputation and consumer trust are key drivers for prioritizing company risks.The mechanisms that are most pertinent to environmental impacts including water consumption and discharge include periodic meetings of the Public Responsibilities Committee of the Kroger Board of Directors; a sustainability materiality assessment process to identify and confirm the most material sustainability topics for the company; regular stakeholder engagement to discuss emerging trends, industry benchmarking, and risks and opportunities pertaining to environmental and social impacts; and dedicated business resiliency and continuity planning to assist in preparing for potential interruptions to business operations due to such factors as extreme weather.Our individual business units--Retail, Manufacturing and Supply Chain--assess risks (and opportunities) specific to their assets and facilities based on their operations and locations.In the case of water risk, we have also worked with a consultant to assess and determine any water risk in our own operations. At this time, we have not identified a substantive water risk for our business, as only 2.2% of facilities are subject to substantive water risk.
A substantive financial or strategic impact is defined as an event that would ultimately delay the timely delivery or quality of a product or service to a customer.A risk matrix that could help to quantify the magnitude, probability and frequency of the impact is currently used within our internal system as a response to known/occurred risk events. At this time, we do not have a water related example that triggered this type of categorization.The risk matrix is made of a leveling categories, A-D, starting from Level A, which is immedidately dangerous, business interuptions more than 1 million dollars or event that triggers community protective measures. The levels go from A-D in decreasing risk. Level D would be a minor event that does not trigger financial impact defined as substantive or external reporting requirements.
Question not applicable
Lam Research has not quantified the financial implications of potential water risk to business, operations, revenue or expenditure. Lam does not believe that they are material to the company. In addition, Lam has developed a Business Continuity Plan in the event of any adverse environmental threats and risks that may affect company personnel, assets, and operations.
Question not applicable

At the company level, we assess water-related risk as part of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program by identifying the risk's likelihood and potential impact. In addition, we also look at the timeframe, management method and cost of management. The scale of the impact severity is defined as ''1â€ for ''minorâ€ which is $0-25 million, ''2â€ for ''moderateâ€, which is $26-100 million, ''3â€ is for ''majorâ€, which is $101-250 million and ''4â€ is for ''severeâ€, which is $251-500 million, and ''5â€ is ''catastrophicâ€ which is over $500 million. When identifying or assessing risks for LVS, substantive financial impact is defined as a scale of impact of $101 million or more in our direct operations. The $101 million threshold is still less than 1% of the company annual revenue. Substantive change is considered to be the closure or halting of services from one our critical tier one suppliers or a change in revenue of $101 million or more in our direct operations.We also evaluate risks through our internal water risk model which leverages two leading industry tools including the WWF Water Risk Filter and WRI Aqueduct tools. To determine whether a property is located in a water stressed area, we average the final risk scores from WWF and WRI, and consider a threshold of greater than 3, which is aligned with industry standards, to be a water stressed region. According to this approach we currently do not withdraw water from any water-stressed regions.Even though water-related risks exist, there are none that currently have the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on business. We update our assessment on a regular basis.Examples of substantive impacts considered include the disruption to business caused by Typhoon Hato in 2017 and the resulting disruption to the local water supply. The impacts of the typhoon were not considered substantive as all Sands China Ltd. properties remained at least partially open and all impacts were below the $101 million threshold. This risk was considered detrimental but not substantive. Please see our response to W2.1 in our 2017 response to learn more about our recovery and relief efforts as well as our amendments to the Business Continuity Plan. We have also considered the impact of risks realized by our critical tier on suppliers.While the risks might not be ''substantiveâ€ to the entire company, the sustainability team still actively reviews and mitigates climate and water-related risks that are significant to the department.
Any negative impact is substantive.
As part of Lenovo's overall environmental risk assessment processes, we have identified water consumption and discharge as a significant risk. Our risk assessment process examines likelihood and severity of impact as well as reputational and compliance risks, controls, normal and abnormal conditions, etc.. Substantive change would be considered anything that might have a material impact on Lenovo's financials, business operations continuity, ability to sell products, etc.During FY16/17, we undertook an exercise to map Lenovo's water risk and evaluate water risk management strategies. As part of this exercise, the five highest water risk Lenovo sites were identified. Lenovo tracks utility spending, including water use and discharge fees. Lenovo has not sized costs related to this water risk at these or any other sites at this time. Lenovo recognizes that there are risks related to water in our supply chain and we require supplier reporting of water data. Lenovo has not mapped our supply chain water risks to date. Lenovo recognizes the potential impact of water risks in Lenovo's supply chain and we evaluate water as part of our supplier RBA and other audits. However, we have not yet undertaken a formal risk based assessment of our supply chain water impacts and risks. This is largely because of limited resources and the fact that existing resources are dedicated to higher risk projects, including labor and human rights in the supply chain, climate change and energy, etc.
Substantive change or impact would be anything that would inhibit Lexmark from delivering products or services to our customers on time or on schedule. Such interruptions to business and operations could impact revenues and agreements with our customers.
As our company does not identify any inherent water-related risks, this also means that it has no significant financial or strategic impact.
While water availability could disrupt portions of our supply chain, the majority of our product portfolio is not water-intensive. The location and diversity of our supplier base serves as a risk-mitigation strategy against potential supply disruptions. Water availability plays a very minor role in our direct operations.
A substantive impact would be any impact resulting in a disruption of our normal operations. Impacts on water supply could result in a shut-down of manufacturing due to lack of water for product cleaning and process cooling systems.
A substantive financial impact in our business imposed by water risk would consist of a disruption in our operations or in the supply of components from our suppliers and/or the delivery of products to our customers for an indeterminate period of time that could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
Marriott does not use a single definition of or financial threshold for "substantive impact" in its risk assessment process. Material risks are those that could adversely impact our business, shareholder value, and reputation. Risks are reviewed annually by the top 250 executives across the company, as well as by the board of directors. All of the risks evaluated may be considered to have the potential for substantive impact, and as a part of the annual review, the risks are prioritized and data is gathered about current and long-term mitigation efforts, challenges, and performance tracking mechanisms. Marriott is a global lodging company with more than 6,900 properties (as of year-end 2018) that we operate (''manageâ€), franchise or license under 30 brands in 130 countries and territories worldwide. This diversification offers some resilience against localized water risks. A substantive financial impact would be one that would impact overall revenue significantly.
The Mars Facility Water Stewardship Risk Assessment Process considers sites against three separate criteria to assess the level of water-related risks and assess whether these are substantive in business terms.  Sites experiencing the greatest water-related risks and issues are identified based on data obtained in our annual Mars Facility Water Risk Assessment Questionnaire (formerly known as the Mars watershed governance survey) which forms part of a wider sustainability data gathering exercise in support of our SiG Plan.  Sites in locations of high (>40%) baseline water stress as per the WRI Aqueduct tool.  Sites producing more than 2% of their business segment's global production volume. Our Food business is an exception where we set the level at 5%, as it has a much smaller number of sites. The proportion of production volume is an indicator of potential business impact in the event of water issues affecting a factory's ability to operate. Most of our products can be manufactured at multiple sites, reducing business continuity risks in the event of a water-related impact production at one facility. Where this is not the case and a site produces unique products, we may rate the business risk as substantive even if the production volume threshold is not met.Sites identified as having the highest water-related risks are defined as ''High Priorityâ€ sites within our Water Stewardship program and are the subject of Water Stewardship Reviews based on the Alliance for Water Stewardship's International Standard. The reviews aim to ensure we build on the information from our Facility Risk Assessments and WRI stress data to build a detailed understanding of local water risks and opportunities.Over 20 level-3 sites will complete water stewardship reviews before 2020. Four reviews were completed at sites in the UK, China and California in 2016 and 2017. During 2018, further reviews took place at four sites in the UK, USA and Poland.In our supply chain, as part of the accounting process for developing our Sustainable in a Generation Plan, we overlaid our raw material origins and volumes with watershed stress maps in a Geographic Information System, to cross-reference water-intensive crops with areas of water stress. This allowed us to identify priority watersheds that represent substantive supply risks. We have used the results to develop a type of science-based target for reducing our most material water impacts in stressed watersheds. More information on this approach is available at www.wri.org/blog/2016/04/companies-could-profit-setting-water-targets-informed-science and our water position statement on Mars.com(https://www.mars.com/global/about-us/policies-and-practices/water-stewardship-position-statement).

Water is a significant component of many of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to restrictions in certain regions.These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
This is consistent with how McCormick characterizes "enterprise risks" which are risks that 1) expose the Company to significant or catastrophic permanent decline in shareholder value and 2) the risk must be reasonably possible.
Question not applicable
Our annual report (form 10-K) defines "substantive" risks as those that could materially adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Risks that rise to this level are captured and discussed in our 10-K in section 1.A, Risk Factors. For more information see http://www.merck.com/investors/
Micron uses a standard ERM process to ensure risks, including water-related risks, can be incorporated into decision-making. The ERM process is aligned with Micron's Strategic and Business Planning Process to ensure appropriate priorities are set and company strategic objectives are met. This creates a unified approach to identify, assess, prioritize, treat, monitor and report risks across the company. As part of the strategic planning process and day-to-day management of the business, internal and external risks that may affect the achievement of our objectives are identified. Water-related risks and overall sustainability risks spanning a 1-10 years time period are identified, assessed, prioritized, and managed as part of this ERM process. Information and communication channels are in place to make the organization aware of risks that fall into their area of responsibility.Micron risk management personnel and subject matter experts assess these risks through their expertise, formal assessments and analysis of business intelligence and trends. Risks and opportunities are then prioritized based upon the overall risk exposure, considered as a function of likelihood (how likely is the risk to occur without treatment) and impact of the occurrence (how impactful is the risk without treatment). Micron leaders are accountable for managing risks affecting their area of responsibility. Risk management personnel are responsible for maintenance and governance of the ERM program, and support the identification, assessment, and reporting of risks to leadership for recommended actions. Each business unit and function communicates identified risks and associated treatments to their leadership teams. The leaders of these functions develop plans and direction for their organization to effectively align the treatment support to the objectives and priorities of the organization. Micron personnel are empowered to make decisions to prioritize risk treatments that are within their span of control. However, all risks are elevated through the ERM process to identify themes across product lines, sites, and assets. This allows prioritization of risks across multiple locations and functions to receive appropriate attention and review by the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis or more frequently as needed.Micron considers substantive financial impact as having the potential for severe and/or irreversible negative impact to Micron's assets, credit liquidity, and/or share price. Water-related risks and opportunities are identified and prioritized by considering the following criteria: business continuity, impact to brand/reputation, relevance to regional operations, alignment with Micron business strategy, impact to communities, and compliance considerations. One example of our risk/opportunity identification and management process includes the risk of enhanced reporting obligations. The likelihood of this occurring and how impactful it would be without treatment is evaluated to determine the inherent risk and then treatment details, including who, what, and when are determined and tracked to closure. The treatments for this example include monitoring water-related regulations and policy to understand and evaluate impacts to, and opportunities for, our business, customers, and the communities where we operate. When applicability is determined, an action plan is developed and monitored through execution.
Microsoft defines substantive strategic or financial impact from water-related risks as follows:  For offices and labs, an impact that would require significantly altering or relocating the operations of a facility or group of facilities that would affect our ability to deliver continuous customer services. This applies to direct operations.  For datacenters, an impact that would require significantly altering or relocating a datacenter that would affect our ability to deliver continuous customer services. The definition of ''continuous customer servicesâ€ in this context is based on a customer's contracted reliability tier. The reliability tier can vary in the Microsoft service level agreements or contracts with customers. This applies to direct operations.  For our suppliers, an impact that would block or delay the delivery of contracted goods or services to the extent that it would affect our ability to deliver continuous customer services or force a change in our business strategy (including, but not limited to, when supplier working conditions no longer meet requirements for the supplier's workplace as a result of a water-related impact). This applies to our supply chain.  For our business overall, an impact that would lead us to alter our business strategy as a result of changes in return on investment, capital expenditures, or the cost of key supplies. This applies to both direct operations and supply chain.Our products and services have minimal water impacts in other stages of the value chain.Subject matter leadership on water-related risk resides with our Environmental Sustainability (ES) team, led by our Chief Environmental Officer. This team assesses comparative risk and impact through consultation with subject matter experts from across the company using formal risk assessments. The results of these assessments are shared with the Microsoft Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. The ERM group anticipates, identifies, assesses, and prioritizes risks and, through regular reporting and discussion, assists our directors with governance of risk. The ERM program has a formal process for assessing the size, scope, and relative significance of the various risks that Microsoft faces, including those related to water. The process involves categorizing risks according to their inherent impact on a scale of 1 (minimal) to 5 (critical) in four categories: trust or reputational; operational scope; legal, compliance, or environmental; and enterprise value. Risks are then rated according to their inherent likelihood on a scale of 1 (remote) to 5 (expected). These two ratings are used to produce an inherent risk score, and any risk for which the inherent risk score exceeds a defined threshold is considered material for reporting to senior management. The two ratings are also aggregated with a management action/control effectiveness rating for a residual risk calculation.An example of a substantive impact considered is the potential for facility damage from an acute weather event, such as flooding. To mitigate this risk, Microsoft has an established Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program, to help ensure the existence of effective, reliable, well-tested plans, systems, and processes that can be counted on during a disruptive event to support continuity of business operations and minimize adverse impacts. The EBCM program works with the ERM team to ensure consistent alignment among risks and risk ratings. (Note that this risk is not substantive; central to Microsoft cloud services design is geographic redundancy, which reduces our vulnerability to physical impacts, including flooding, and offers customers the option of a resilient alternative to on-premises datacenters.)
Question not applicable
As ModusLink's water consumption is primarily used for human consumption and sanitation, it does not pose significant risks to interruption of production. ModusLink defines substantive risks as risks that could affect greater than 1% of the company's total revenue from direct operations.
Substantive impacts to operations include flooding, drought, poor water quality, or water scarcity. Any of these can stop operations and thus impact our ability to serve customers.

Question not applicable
Question not applicable
We define a substantive financial or strategic impact as one that would result in a material change in the cost to produce products or the ability to produce products or grow into new markets.
Although we do not use water within our manufacturing processes, we consider our company and supply chain subject to risks related to water, but do not consider the risks to be significant. Like all companies, extreme weather events and resource shortages have the potential to interrupt our business and supply chain operations. However, Motorola Solutions' operations generally are not located in low-lying areas subject to severe impacts from flooding or drought. Any disruption to our distribution channels could have a detrimental impact on our supply chain and product distribution. Losses and interruption could be caused by water shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters, for which we predominantly are self-insured.
Question not applicable
Any substantive strategic impact would be any area that would have a direct impact on our ability to service our customers requirements. For financial impact, this would be any potential impact to have an effect of3% or greater in our overall performance.

A substantive change to our organization for both our direct operation and supply chain is one that is material to the company. To understand the potential for substantive change, our risk identification and assessment process goes through a multi-pronged approach. We rate risks on factors such as impact, severity, frequency, and likelihood. We temper this with a look into our controls/mitigations in place or in process. This process is conducted on an ongoing basis, but reported out to the executives on a quarterly cadence. Our rating scale has several elements such as financial impact, regulatory, customer impact, reputational, etc.Water related risks including water scarcity and extreme storms are included in these analyses of the potential for substantive risk. For example, droughts could have an impact on operating expenses at our Sunnyvale facility (if tiered water rates change) as well as on capital expenditures if we are required to retrofit some of our existing cooling towers to reduce the consumption of domestic water. In addition, water availability could affect the prices of our components, since a number of our suppliers (e.g., semiconductor manufacturers) can use significant amounts of water in their manufacturing processes.
Except few plants, most of our plants water usage is only for domestic purposes and close loop circulation (non -contact) for Chillers/Evaporation tanks (less than 1%)
Newmont defines substantive financial impacts on the business as follows:A significant operation change or expenditure greater than $1 million. Elements of substantive change include the following:- Rapidly increasing social, political and media concern leading to project delays, increased costs- Increasing pressure on water use due to in-migration of communities in proximity to our operations that could impact our operations- Water scarcity and water surplus leading to production constraints and increased costs- Increasingly stringent regulations focused on water management and discharge requirements leading to increased costs- Increasing financial exposure at closure due to increasingly stringent regulations and water treatment costsNewmont defines substantive strategic impact on the business as follows:  Significant risk: Newmont's Risk Management Standard defines significant risks as those risks that are identified as "high" or "extreme", as defined on the Newmont Risk Matrix.  Strategic risk: Newmont defines strategic risks as a long-term risk (e.g. three years) that sets the overall direction of the organization with respect to the Health and Safety, Sustainability and External Relations, and Business planning.Newmont considers water a material issue and emerging risk; continuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining operations.Our 10K 2018 Annual Report (pg 214) discusses the potential business impact of the risk (excerpted here), "Our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our operations in North and South America and Australia are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights, claims and contracts and to defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights, claims and contracts to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to our water rights, claims, contracts and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company's control. For example, the continuation of the below average rainfall or the occurrence of drought in southwest Australia could impact our raw water supply at Boddington. While we incorporated systems to address the impact of the dry season as part of our operating plans, we can make no assurances that those systems will be sufficient to address all shortages in water supply, which could result in production and processing interruptions. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely affecting our operations.â€
NIPSCO electric generation relies on adequate water for purposes of appropriate non-contact cooling. Insufficient water would limit our ability to operate.
We produce aluminum sheet and light gauge products for use in multiple markets, which includes beverage can. Our single largest end-use market is beverage can sheet. The beverage market is highly dependent on fresh clean water as a key raw material, within the manufacturing process and other product ingredients. Certain of our customers in the beverage market are significant to our revenues, and we could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of these significant customers or by the loss of their business.
NRG's definition of substantive water risk is the possibility that an event will occur and significantly alter the achievement of NRG's business goals. Risk identification and assessment process applies to both direct operations and supply chain. NRG uses the measures, metrics and indicators for water risk assessment leveraging the management and professional judgment from the following perspectives: â€¢Financial impact:  1)Corporate earnings 2)Capital expenditure on technologies to reduce water consumption and withdrawal  â€¢Plant operation  1)Operation disruption due to water shortage 2)Increase in costs of water usage 3)Supply chain risk â€¢Environmental impact 1)Water availability  2)Water quality of river basins 3)Regulations that impact supply and/or management of waterWater risk is monitored by the risk owners (individual plant operators) and reported to management upon material changes with a threshold of 20% in water consumption and withdrawal levels. Water risks for the purposes of this disclosure are considered to have substantive financial impact to NRG's business if they could impact a significant proportion of the company's gross margin from power generation in a given region. An example is the risk of water shortage in the Brazos River and its potential to interrupt operations at the WA Parish plant. If it is determined that a water supply risk exists that could impact projected generation levels within any plant within the subsequent two-year time frame, risk mitigation efforts are identified and economically evaluated for implementation. NRG SVP, Plant Operations reviews modelling scenarios generated for water risk determination. Plant level NRG Water usage analysis is reviewed annually. NRG water usage analysis is reviewed by the senior leaders of NRG Operations, Engineering and Commercial Operations.

With input from our finance team, we have created thresholds for determining climate risks and opportunities that present a substantive financial impact for our business for CDP reporting. This definition applies both to our direct operations and our supply chain. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we determined that an event or series of events that cumulatively cause in any given quarter $6 million in lost or additional revenue and/or $4 million in additional or reduced Cost of Goods Sold or Operating Expenses qualifies as a substantive financial impact. An example of a substantive opportunity arises where our technology is being leveraged to research and solve global water related challenges, thereby driving additional revenue for our business. In addition to these financial criteria, we consider the results of our CSR materiality assessment in determining which issues are strategically relevant for our business. In FY19, we identified six priority issues as essential to our continued business success. These issues reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders:
Occidental follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which has defined rules for oil and gas reporting disclosures with the aim to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves and financial valuation. These same rules cover guidance regarding the types of issues an oil and gas company should consider when preparing its Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) in its Form 10-K and other financial filings, including disclosure regarding substantive financial impact (or changes) due to technology, prices and concession conditions.

Operations at a few plants require a significant quantity of water. Therefore, water related risks have the potential to cause substantial change in direct business operations. Depending on severity and the likelihood of water challenges derived from the watershed/basin, it might impact local business units as well as revenue or expenditure at a global level. For example, if water quantity and/or quality were to decline, we could face raising costs due to increased intake and disposal costs, reducing operational revenue. To determine the potential at-risk facilities, we first identify all sites listed as having "extremely high" baseline water stress from the Aqueduct Tool. Baseline water stress measures the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to total available annual renewable supply, accounting for upstream consumptive use. We then cross reference that with our water use and production levels at each of those sites. To be considered significant the total amount of production from those sites within the basin must be above 3%. Once plants cross both the extremely high risk and 3% production in the basin threshold they are considered to have the potential of substantive change on our business. We use our supplier segmentation process to identify those suppliers that are critical to our operations based on a variety of risk factors including availability of substitutions and level of spend. Based on the results of the segmentation process suppliers representing 85% of our spend go through additional water risk assessments including the Aqueduct Tool.
Substantive financial impact would be impacting more than 15% of revenue for a given location or total company.
PepsiCo incorporates the following factors when defining substantive change in PepsiCo's direct operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk: 1) magnitude of potential impact on operating costs and/or current and future revenue; and 2) potential impact on stakeholder expectations or perceptions. Substantive change would generally be considered any material change (+/- 5%) to a site's operating environment/costs and/or to PepsiCo's reputation locally, regionally or globally. One example of a potential substantive impact would be the prolonged closure of a manufacturing facility due to water-related issues. While neither were characterized as 'substantive', in 2018 we saw examples of production disruptions at our facilities in Cape Town (due to the 2018 'Day Zero' emergency) and in southern India due to flooding. Should such material change occur, the impact (and any potential need to review the definition) would be reviewed and re-assessed by our senior executive team. This definition of substantive change applies to both direct operations and to elements of our supply and value chains (for example, changes to how we source agricultural raw materials due to water-related risks).
Question not applicable
Business interruption due to flooding associated with storm water or interruption of water supply
For the purposes of this response, Pfizer defines ''substantiveâ€ risk as any impact that could adversely impact the company's business or financial condition or disrupt, delay or inhibit the supply of medically-necessary products to patients. For risks that can be evaluated financially, Pfizer has applied a threshold of $100MM for considering a risk substantive in this context. Pfizer defines ''medically-necessaryâ€ products as those products identified by our internal businesses to provide treatment for a life-threatening condition for which there are no alternatives available. Pfizer applies these criteria when assessing both direct and indirect risks and opportunities.CDP's phrasing of "substantive" and our response to questions presenting "substantive" risks should not be considered to relate to matters or facts that could be deemed ''materialâ€ to a reasonable investor as referred to under U.S. securities laws or similar requirements of other jurisdictions. Investors should refer to disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ("10-k") and in our other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K, for a discussion of "material" matters.
Water risks for PG&E are defined as those that have a strategic impact on PG&E's business of providing safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy for its customers and impact the long-term sustainability of PG&E as a company. PG&E refreshed its third-party led materiality assessment, which identified priorities for the long-term sustainability of our business. Developed through a structured process that included interviews with internal and external stakeholders, the assessment identified 18 material issues, including PG&E's GHG emissions, renewable energy, and climate change resilience. PG&E's Corporate Sustainability team then worked with the Corporate Strategy team to ensure the results of the materiality assessment informed and were appropriately reflected in PG&E's business strategy. Our water-related risk management efforts focus primarily on drought mitigation, climate change, once-through cooling, land subsidence, groundwater management, storm water, drinking water, water use and recycling, and discharge limitations.
PMI evaluates a ''substantive impactâ€ (e.g.: financial or strategic impact) based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the potential impact on financial performance as well as other factors that may affect PMI's efforts towards a smoke-free future, ultimately replacing cigarettes with smoke-free products.As part of the Company's annual Integrated Risk Assessment (IRA) process we have conducted a Climate Change Risk Assessment to evaluate and understand the impact of climate change and water-related issues on PMI businesses. When assessing risks related to climate change and water we consider long term horizons (2030 and 2040 scenarios), multiple climate and water related indicators and impact drivers including but not limited to climate change events that may:- influence or impact our operations (e.g., raw material sourcing, factories, finished goods distribution);- affect a large number of areas where we source tobacco and/or other raw materials, impacting the continuity of supply for years, and consequently driving related cost up;- trigger a competition in resources demand, natural disaster, water scarcity and change in weather patterns, impacting the availability of raw materials.In 2018 we have performed climate change risk and opportunity assessment following the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) methodology. This allowed the evaluation of transition risks in addition to the physical ones considering impact drivers such as cost, asset efficiency and reputation. As part of our IRA process, we have also put in place an extensive risk control program by which to assess the climate change physical risks including the water related ones. Locations with values exceeding $30 million range are surveyed by engineers from our property insurer, who provide recommendations to us on the magnitude of environmental risks and the cost of management. Recommendations for risk management are given if the expected reduction in the financial impact of the risk exceeds the cost to comply by a factor of 10 or more. Internally, we focus on recommendations above the $50 million range as management of identified risks can involve substantial capital investment and disruption to operations including our supply chain.In 2020+ risk forecasting terms, in relation to our tobacco supply chain, we assumed as substantive risks those with a potential impact in excess of US$5M or a raw material impact in excess of 1000 metric tons of tobacco leaves. This definition is applicable to PMI's agricultural supply chain. Over the last couple of years, we have been expanding our water programs by first assessing current and future water-related risks more broadly across our value chain. These risks include water scarcity and water quality in tobacco growing regions, flood risk in major tobacco warehouse locations and ports, and water demand in cities where we have manufacturing facilities. Besides our tobacco supply chain, we have developed a water footprint analysis with Quantis to understand water stressed hotspots from which we source materials that are production water intensive. An example of a substantive impact identified is the threat of flooding and cyclones in the Philippines, Russia, Hungary, Italy, and Japan that could cause damage in our manufacturing and warehouse sites estimated in a range of $10-25M for each location according to our insurer estimation.
APS defines substantive change to our direct operations and supply chain related to water risk in three ways. First, a physical disruption of a water supply that limited generation at any APS power plant would constitute a substantive and disruptive change. We define substantive change as any loss of generation capacity, (i.e. less than 100%) due to insufficient water supply. If a vital piece of infrastructure is damaged or becomes inoperable, output could be impacted or generation could be curtailed entirely. In addition, this can incur additional costs and impact supply chain demand. Second, APS and/or supplier noncompliance with a permit or regulatory requirement could impact production and/or result in notices of violations and penalties. Finally, APS and supplier allocation cuts related to water shortages would impact production. An example of a metric designed to reduce the probability of infrastructure failure is the Well and Pumping Equipment Reliability Program. Well infrastructure failure could have a financial impact and/or a production impact as wells are needed at eight of our nine plants to provide essential water to support generation. To prevent this impact, the Well and Pumping Equipment Reliability Program increased frequency of preventive maintenance activities, replaced existing wells with new wells, and increased the frequency of major well rehabilitations. The result was that well failures have decreased from 5/year in 2015 to a single failure in 2018. Also, if there was a water shortage that impacted a supplier provided product or service, depending on the criticality there could be substantive impacts to APS's operations. Water quality and quantity is vital to our direct operations, and is considered neutral to our indirect operations.
Impact to our operations because of water related risks may result in loss of production, and employee retention issues resulting in lower sales and impact to business objectives.

We define substantive financial or strategic impact to our business as those events having an impact on sales or earnings, on our operations or those of our key suppliers, or on the ability of our customers to effectively use our products.
Our PVH's General Counsel and Corporate Risk team determined that our organization defines a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business that has a 0.5% impact revenue or earnings per share.PVH's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process identifies risks most material to the business. Risks are ranked based on likelihood and control comfort. Sourcing risk, identified as a top risk through the ERM process, includes the potential for natural disasters (e.g., floods, droughts), and volatile commodity costs, particularly in key sourcing countries. In addition to PVH's ERM process, we undertook a water risk assessment in 2016. Per WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter tool, three types of risks are identified; physical risk, reputational risk, and regulatory risk. Physical risk is defined as water quantity (e.g., scarcity, flooding, and droughts) and quality (pollution) within the river basin and the impacts this might have on society and the environment. Regulatory risk is defined as the strength and enforcement of water regulations and the consequences of restrictions by public institutions; felt either through direct regulatory action or from neglect, blockages, or failure. Reputational risk is defined as perceptions around water use, pollution, and behavior that may have negative impacts on the company brand and influence purchasing decisions. Public perceptions can emerge rapidly when local aquatic systems and community access to water are affected. Substantive change is defined as changes in availability, continuity, price, quality, delivery time and reliability of the supply base or the public opinion that affects sourcing performance, sourcing strategy and/or the company reputation.
See Pyxus International 10-K report, on www.pyxus.com at http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000939930/a438f823-4c7c-4704-af5a-8a0e3a164fd6.pdf beginning on Page 68.Related to water, seasonal rainfall fluctuations may affect the volume and quality of crop production on farms within our supply chain. We judge the riskto our business as low at this time due to our flexibility to source from other origins. A substantive change could require alternative product sourcing from other locations and we have proven global supply chains to deliver this flexibility.

Qualcomm's annual risk assessment of our operations includes the consideration, review and prioritization of various company risks by a cross-functional group of key representatives from legal, finance, human resources and internal audit, as well as a sensitivity analysis. A substantive change for both our direct operations and our supply chain is one that is material to the company. When conducting a risk assessment to identify material risks, we consider the scale of the potential financial impact and the likelihood of the impact on our key business drivers, including employee attraction and retention, future growth strategy, innovation, meeting customers' needs, and supply chain management. Materiality is determined by combining a risk's scores on a variety of business and environmental indices according to a proprietary weighting formula. Each identified risk has a documented mitigation plan.
Raytheon considers water-related risks to be location specific but currently does not deem water to pose a material impact to our business. To identify substantive financial or strategic impact we would consider the impact, probability, frequency and likelihood of water risks. Water risks are considered directly through the Aqueduct model, as well as through our routine Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) processes.  Raytheon is not a water intensive company in its production or comfort cooling/facilities uses. This definition applies to direct operations for the CDP Water Security only.We work across the enterprise to put mitigation plans in place in areas where we have water risks. For example, Raytheon worked on a project to replace process cooling towers in Arizona with centralized process cooling using plate/frame heat exchangers and thermal storage system return water as a more water efficient process.
Question not applicable
Regeneron defines a substantive financial or strategic business impact from water risks to be anything that disrupts the business across four Business Impact Analysis (BIA) criteria. The four impact criteria include financial materiality, compliance, operational and competitive edge, and shareholder/stakeholder confidence value. These impacts are rated on a scale with six levels: very low, low, medium, high, very high and extreme. The BIA criteria are written and re-evaluated at least two times per year by a collaborative effort between Real Estate and Facilities Management, Security, and Environment Health & Safety. Water-related risks are identified and assessed within these BIA criteria. A risk with a medium to extreme impact would result in a substantive financial impact costing greater than $50M. An example of this would be the magnitude of extra operational expenses incurred as a result of a manufacturing site's inability to access fresh water. Regeneron considers this to be a low potential risk in the short-term, but understands that limited access to fresh, quality water may affect long term viability as the company continues to expand. This definition only applies to our direct operations and does not include considerations to our suppliers' water related risks.
Question not applicable
Financial impacts relate to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including: volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices; capital structure; and credit and liquidity risk, including risk related to cash management, extension of credit, collections, credit ratings, and availability and cost of funding.Strategic risks relate to our future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with the global macroenvironment in which we operate, trends in our industry, demand for our products, competitive threats, product innovation, public policy developments, resource allocation, and strategic initiatives, including mergers and acquisitions, dispositions, and restructuring activity.Substantive change would mean the inability to operate one of our facilities due to conditions of flooding, drought, inability to meet environmental regulations, unacceptable compliance cost, or significant changes to fiber supply.
Rockwell defines substantive change to our business to be when more than 5% of operations, revenue or expenditure is impacted, at the corporate level. This threshold is then applied to reporting water-related substantive risks. For example, if a supply-chain is disrupted as a result of prolonged drought in one region and this contributes to a reduction in production globally but it is less than 5% at the corporate level. Consequently this risk would NOT be reported in question W3.2d as an example of a water risk that could cause a substantive change to business, operations, revenue or expenditure as it did not exceed the threshold for substantive change to our business at the corporate level.

We have an internal risk assessment process detailing how we define substantive impact on our business. However, this is sensitive information we are not ready to disclose.

Sempra Energy's mission is to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company. Our ''path to premierâ€ is based on six critical success factors: world-class safety; energy choice, security and reliability; innovation and technology; a talented, diverse and engaged workforce; financial excellence; and energy leadership with purpose.Sempra Energy defines and identifies risk factors that could have a material financial impact on our business and in relation to our mission in our 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The risk factors outlined in the 10-K are those that could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The 10-K identifies the following risk factors that are or could be a result of water-related issues, such as the potential for tsunamis, floods, mudslides, and especially drought.Additionally, water-risks that could have a strategic impact on our business are those that would impact Sempra's ability to meet our critical success factors, such as our ability to provide safe and reliable energy service to our customers. These risks do not meet the threshold of materiality relevant to our 10-K filing, but we believe are useful in providing context to the significance of water in our operations and supply chain and therefore merit inclusion in this discussion.For transparency purposes, in the responses below we have also included additional water-related risks that we have identified, for example operating infrastructure in water stressed areas (based on a threshold of 1,700 cubic meters of renewable water supply per person). These risks do not meet the threshold of materiality relevant to our 10-K filing, but we believe it is useful in providing context to the significance of water in our operations and supply chain and therefore merit inclusion in this discussion.
Semtech leadership teams evaluate risks and assess those risks and listed in our quality manual an d posted on our website.

Using the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool, we observed which major manufacturing and distribution facilities were located in water-stressed regions (having a "High" or "Extremely High" overall water risk as determined by the tool) . Substantive change will depend on how much product is produced or distributed from that facility and the availability and cost of water and our ability to move production to other regions.

Water is required for certain operations in Brazil's manufacturing site. It is critical to have water available as this contributes to 40-50% of the production.
Essentially anything that would have any financial or strategic impact is considered. A further review by those with knowledge of the impact determines if the impact is substantive and if any action is required. The variety of potential impacts is such that no sprecific thresholds are defined.
A substantive change would be defined as disruption in operations lasting one day or more. For instance, if it was impossible to provide sufficient drinking water to workers and offices needed to be evacuated or activities on construction site would have to stop. Some projects rely on "On time delivery" and if delivery of critical components was delayed because of an acute weather event or a significant change in physical conditions, the calendar of the project could also be disrupted.
The Company's operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure, notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities, which are concentrated in various geographic locations. Water-related factors that are hard to predict or are beyond the Company's control, i.e. weather (including any potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, supply and commodity shortages, terrorism, political unrest, cybersecurity breaches, or health pandemics; could damage or disrupt the Company's infrastructure, or that of its suppliers or distributors. If the Company does not effectively plan for or respond to disruptions in its operations, or cannot quickly repair damage to its information, production or supply systems, the Company may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products and services to its customers, and the quality and safety of its products and services might be negatively affected. If a material or extended disruption occurs, the Company may lose its customers' or business partners' confidence or suffer damage to its reputation, and long-term consumer demand for its products and services could decline. Although the Company maintains business interruption insurance, it may not fully protect the Company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions. These events could materially and adversely affect the Company's product sales, financial condition and results of operations.Therefore, we define substantive strategic impact as a situation or circumstance such as the potential temporary or permanent closure of an operation or facility, which compromises our manufacturing processes, upstream and downstream supply chains, and so compromises our provision of products and services to our customers. It may also include opportunities with limited financial benefit, but provide a water efficiency improvement that contributes to SBD's 2030 CSR Goals, and in turn, the UN Sustainable Development Goals.A temporary or permanent closure of an operation or facility could be caused by a situation where the welfare or health and safety of our employees is compromised. Each of our individual sites represents no more than 1% of the overall revenue, but we still regard this as being a financially substantive impact. Therefore, we define the substantive financial impact as any situation where at least a single facility with less than 1% overall revenue is impacted. This would be the highest magnitude impact, however, the probability for such is extremely low (no previous or foreseeable occurrences), and we account for this with business continuity planning. Fresh quality water is important to our operations (we are not reliant on recycled water); however, we have a relatively low estimated overall water risk and are not a water intensive consumer in terms of manufacturing process or sourcing, etc. Local site's emergency management plans capture basic business continuity issues, i.e. loss of services such as water and power. Due to the geographical spread of operations (manufacturing, supply chain & administration), it is unlikely that a water-related event in a region would impact multiple facilities. In case of a water-related incident (i.e. insufficient water quantity or quality), our Dallas, Zhongshan and Wuxi facilities may pose a substantive impact on SBD's GTS Business. GTS is the largest business unit with the highest revenue within SBD. Each identified site represents less than 1% of the overall revenue. The realistic worst-case scenario being a complete loss of a manufacturing facility in a region, would only accumulate to less than 1% of overall revenue. Shareholder/customer concerns and water-related risk are in scope of our business continuity for each site, as we follow a localization model of "make where we sell." An example of a business continuity plan would be if a manufacturing process was impacted by regional water scarcity, it may be mitigated by increasing output in parallel manufacturing processes in non-impacted regions. SBD's global Water Risk Plan has foundation in our 2012 strategic communication, our 2013 launch of our global water scarcity strategy, and our 2014-16 updates including establishment of 2015 re-baseline global water withdrawal intensity heavily reliant on the WRI Aqueduct data and 2020 reduction target. This in-process management method includes mapping SBD global locations against the United Nations Environment Program's vital water graphic layers for a multi-faceted risk evaluation to prioritize top water risk sites. Then, instituting water conservation efforts, governmental collaboration projects, and options for alternative water strategies at high risk sites. Sites in high or extremely high-water risk areas are re-assessed annually, to determine local risk and actions towards water security. We also use this management method to assess potential water risk in acquisition transaction due diligence.
Substantive change would be any change considered material to our financial results, such as impacting a significant number of stores in a region, as well as changes which would require significant capital investment. We review our business annually during development of our operating plan and review progress against this quarterly. While local water issues such as the Flint water crisis or the California drought have had impacts on our operations on stores in those regions, the financial impact was not significant enough to deem this a financial risk to Starbucks. We recognize those water challenges are serious in those communities, Starbucks is always doing it's best to help, whether it's providing safe drinking water or installing drought tolerant landscaping, Starbucks always aims to be good community water stewards.

Suncor uses an enterprise-wide risk management system (ERM) to assess and define risk. Like most ERM systems it uses a matrix that determines the consequence of a risk and the likelihood of it occurring. There are six (6) consequence and likelihood categories. The ERM assign risks a ranking from I to IV for economic, environmental and social. Social is further broken down into health & safety, reputation and regulatory with guidance. Suncor defines substantive risks that are risked rank at II or I; to define substantive change for the purpose of this assessment; an economic value of $10M was used. This includes direct financial costs and lost opportunity value (LOV).
For CDP reporting, we consider risks and opportunities that could deliver $10 million or more revenue change or a $5 million or more operating cost change within a given year to represent a substantive financial impact. A change would also be considered substantive if it directly impacted our corporate reputation and/or brand value and/or if it directly affected the wellbeing of our employees. The scope of this definition includes risks and opportunities arising in the direct, supply chain (upstream) and customer (downstream) segments of our value chain. Examples of potential substantive impacts taken into consideration include increased operating costs should water prices rise in the event of prolonged water shortages, and lost business if we do not meet customer expectations or are unable to meet customer demand for our hardware products if our manufacturing supply chain is negatively impacted by water-related events such as severe flooding. In parallel to our water risk assessment, our Corporate Responsibility (CR) team evaluates the relative importance of a range of CR issues to our external stakeholders and our internal management team through our CR materiality assessment process, and this process includes water issues. Through this process we identify 3 categories of CR issues; â€˜priority', â€˜important' and â€˜other', based on their importance to our stakeholders and our business. Issues falling into the â€˜priority' and â€˜important' categories would be considered substantive for the purpose of CDP reporting. We are also currently evaluating how to best incorporate climate and water risk aspects into our company-wide Business Impact Assessment (BIA) process.
Substantive change in our direct operations is measured primarily by financial impact. With respect to water, substantive change is based upon a high-level assessment of water risks at our operating locations that could result in a "High" or "Very High" financial impact based on EBITDA and a "highly likely/imminent" or "frequently" likelihood as defined in Sysco's proprietary Risk Rating Criteria. Estimated CY2018 EBITDA at risk is used to determine the appropriate Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High financial impact category, while likelihood of the risk is used to determine the extremely unlikely, unlikely, occasionally, highly likely/imminent, and frequently likelihood category.
A substantive impact is an impact that could potentially be material to our business and would require disclosure through reports and filings.
Target considers multiple factors in evaluating risk. Target considers risks substantive when they are assessed to be high or critical using proprietary criteria. Importantly, something that has a "substantive financial or strategic impact on our business" is not necessarily "material" to investors as defined by the SEC.Target's answers to this questionnaire contain forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations.

We define substantive impacts from water risks, to our direct operations, to include:- sanctions corresponding to an interruption of production or cessation of activity for a short-term but finite duration; - significant, longer-term or offsite community or environmental impact requiring significant mitigation or additional long-term controls; and/or, - financially, we define a substantive change to an operation using a cost threshold.We apply these definitions to our risk management framework to determine the severity of incidents based on their potential environmental, safety, community, reputational and financial impacts. Based on the definitions above and our risk ranking process, we did not have any incidents that met these thresholds in 2018.
An impact that could cause disruption to manufacturing and subsequent delivery obligations.
Direct use of sufficient volume and quality of water is vital for Tessy Plastics' manufacturing molding operations. Tessy's definition of a substantive change from water risk would be on direct operations and be the inability to withdraw from local municipalities enough water to operate 60% of Tessy's roughly 260 injection molding presses, which maintains a high enough revenue to pay for operational costs. In the reporting year, this amount was roughly 30 megaliters. A 30-day safety stock of critical customer components is warehoused to mitigate this potential change in Tessy's operations and revenue for the short-term. One example of this substantive impact is drought, as rations from the municipalities would likely not allow us to pull enough water for 60% of production.
TI considers a ''substantive financial or strategicâ€ impact on our business to be one that is a material and lasting concern for our operations, which could result from any one of the following risk factors:- Substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures.- Changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.- Domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions.- Breaches or disruptions of information technology systems.- Natural events in the locations in which we operate.- Rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products.- Supply chain and manufacturing risks.- Warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings.- Complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject.- Changes in tax-related matters.- Customer or distributor suffers losses with respect to our inventory.- Distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance.- Varying margins.- Ability to enforce intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation.- Debt or changes in the financial markets.- Increases in health care and pension benefit costs.- Ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment.- Ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations.- Material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations.
There are 72 risk factors in our Business Level Water Risk Assessment, and these are accounted for on a points-based scale. Each of the 72 risks is assessed on criteria that are relevant to the specific risk factor and are assessed at the local level, on a scale that is locally relevant. An assessment is made for both the likelihood, as well as the consequence of the risk event transpiring, and the results are aggregated to determine a risk score for each factor.Each risk factor is given a score of 1 to 5 for the consequence to the business of the event transpiring, with 5 being the most severe, including such consequences (depending on the specific risk factor) as having critical implication for the company's operations or diverting the business resources to the issue on a full-time basis. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a score of 1 is given to risks that would result in minor losses or impacts, for the specific risk factor in question.Each risk factor is also given a score of 1 to 5 for the likelihood of the risk transpiring, with 5 being the highest, at greater than 90% likelihood, or the risk event either being expected to transpire or already transpiring. A score of 4 is 71-90% of likelihood, 3 is 41 - 70% likelihood, and 2 is 10 - 40%, with 1 being the least likely at less than 10% likely that it will occur, under exceptional and unusual circumstances or extreme conditions.The scores for consequence and likelihood are then multiplied together, and risks with a score of 15 - 25 are categorized in the highest priority, 8 - 14 high priority, 4 - 7 moderate, and 1 - 3 low.Depending on the risk factor (of which there are 72), there are a number of measures through which business consequence and likelihood are measured:- Disruption of production, ranging from potential plant closure to an inability to operate at full capacity- Increased costs resulting in lost profit or lost production and therefore lost revenue- Damage to corporate or brand reputation leading to loss of revenueWe define â€˜substantive impact' as an event that will probably occur or we expect to occur within a three year horizon and has the potential to result in a materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of our operations (as defined in our 2018 10K pages 9-20) and result in catastrophic loss to the environment or community services and well-being of the communities we serve.Based on these assessments, we aim to mitigate risks by introducing actions which, in some cases, could bring forth significant changes in strategic areas of importance to our company. The effectiveness of these mitigation plans, beyond repeated risk assessments, are tracked through key water-related KBI's introduced across the Coca-Cola system:- Manufacturing facility performance (efficiency, reuse, stormwater management, and wastewater treatment), (KBI: liters of product per liter of water used per facility (target -25% between 2010 and 2020) and number of facilities in compliance with our waste water and stormwater management requirements)- Replenishment of product water use: By 2020, safely return to communities and nature an amount of water equal to what we use in our finished beverages and their production. (KBI: liters of annual sales volume versus liters of water benefits generated)
Dow recognizes that water availability can change at any given moment in time.The complexity and consequences of the water cycle are closely monitored to ensure Dow's ability to operate safely andefficiently. At several sites scenarios have been formulated examining the impact of long and mid-term changes in water quantity and quality. For example, Dow Aratu qualified as a second tier in Dow'swater risk analysis, having suffered from a drought in 2017, is currently reviewing the results of a water reliability study aim at developing initial design concepts and corresponding order-of-magnitudecost estimates for viable water supply scenarios defining an appropriate contingency plan.

In this context, we define "substantive" as issues that could have a material impact on our business.
The Kraft Heinz Company defines substantive as an issue or situation that either has a high likelihood of occurring or carries a high degree of significance to our business.

Some of the biggest impacts are outlined here. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of reducing demand for some of our products, increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays, increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories, increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; and creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.For a full list of substantive financial and strategic impact definitions and examples please review Thermo Fisher Scientific's annually filed 10-K.

Finacial or stratigeic impact is based on loss off produciton time or finished product.
Trimble considers water-related risks to be location specific but currently does not consider water to pose a material impact to our business . Trimble doesnot rely heavily on water resource for its manufacturing operations and hence, it does not encounter conflicts with other water users at a local level. The current water quantity and quality at our facilities meet our demands without impacting the water basins in which we operate. Trimble will continuously assess the water usage as a part of risk management activities and will address any water related issues, internal & external stake holder concerns as needed in future.

Tyson Foods, Inc. does not have a comprehensive definition of ''substantive impact,â€ though, as a publicly-traded company, Tyson Foods, Inc. is subject to various regulatory and contractual standards related to the measurement, reporting, and disclosure of impacts to the company's business. Many of these standards are financial- and/or risk-based and are publicly available. We are committed to the responsible management of our water resources, and acknowledge that significant changes in water availability could have an impact on our company and supply chain. We recognize water of suitable quality and volume is a finite resource.That's why, we maintain a goal to reduce the amount of water used to produce each pound of product by 12%, by the end of 2020, using Fiscal 2015 as the baseline year. In 2018 Tyson collaborated with the World Resources Institute (WRI) to conduct a Water Risk Assessment. As part of this risk assessment we conducted an analysis of water risk and scarcity across our direct operations and our supply chain in the United States using the WRI Aqueduct tool. Thirteen facilities were identified to be in high-risk areas. The results of this collaboration was Tyson to become an industry leader by setting outcome- based water conservation targets for our direct operations and our supply chain.

As a railroad with a vast network, we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, extreme temperatures, and significant precipitation, all of which may have a material adverse impact on the company's results and its direct operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Severe weather can result in significant business interruptions and expenditures. Line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network and can adversely affect revenue, costs, and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.The company integrates water risks/opportunities into a multi-disciplinary company-wide risk management process. The company utilizes its enterprise risk management (ERM) tool to incorporate input from strategic planning, operations, law, and the environmental management team, among others, to identify potential water related risks and opportunities.
UTC uses the "substantive" definition included in CDP guidance and defines a substantive impact to our businesses to be those events that have a significant impact on UTC's overall corporate performance. This would include events that resulted in a substantial impact to sales revenue, total company profit, corporate reputation and strategic plans.
Could halt operations or have a severe adverse effect on the ability to achieve strategic objectives, could have a severe impact and exposure resulting in a material weakness, $10M+ value impact, and/or sustained, serious loss in reputation/market share.

Varian defines â€˜substantive' on a case-by-case basis, evaluating impacts to operations, supply chain, product quality, customer satisfaction, employee health & safety, and reputation. Examples of potentially substantive impacts may include increased capital costs or operational expenditures, disruption or delays in production as a result of severe storms or flooding or poor supplier water quality. Substantive changes are measurable year over year.Varian prioritizes risks and opportunities by evaluating several criteria, including: the return on investment in conjunction with the degree of urgency (evaluated via potential magnitude of financial impact and likelihood of occurrence), potential for increased operational efficiencies and reduced costs. Our evaluation of risks applies to both direct operations and supply chain because the availability of high quality freshwater is important for (1) our direct operations so we can provide our employees with an adequate supply of drinking water and (2) our suppliers because product defects could occur if standards are not met, resulting in increased costs and product delays. Customer satisfaction is based on product quality which is directly affected by our suppliers' water quality.Varian prioritizes those risks likely to cause business continuity issues or potentially disrupt production or operations. Opportunities may be escalated based on customer or employee interest or on their potential for attracting or retaining talent.
Our definition of substantive financial risk, as it relates to any of the water risks mentioned below, wouldâ€¯beâ€¯any impact with a likely probability over the next 5-10 years affecting 1% of our revenue or 1% of ourâ€¯costâ€¯ofâ€¯goods soldâ€¯(COGS) caused by regulatoryâ€¯orâ€¯reputationalâ€¯risk. Strategic risks include impacts that have a reputational impact to our brand(s), a lower probability threshold, and/or do not meet the financial threshold as defined above. The risks disclosed in this report meet the conditions for strategic risk but do not yet meet the threshold for substantive financial risk.
Forced to alter or move production due to flooding or total lack of available water.
For the purposes of evaluating our mitigation plans associated with water risk for the CDP survey, what constitutes material impact, also referred to as substantive impact, can depend on a number of factors. In the context of water-related issues and this response, a substantive impact can be described as a measurable financial impact that may be on the order of one or more percentage points of the company's annual net income and then evaluated against attenuating factors. These factors could include expected time horizon it will likely occur, the range of uncertainty in its magnitude, the likelihood of occurrence, and our ability to mitigate the risk.
Waste Management defines substantive strategic impact as events that directly impact the day-to-day operations of our facilities for an extended period of time, not only in terms of additional costs to maintain operations but also in potential lost revenues from the inability to service our customers via collection, hauling, and disposal of materials. WM has sites that operate in a variety of regions, therefore the magnitude of the individual financial impacts of these operational disruptions will vary from site to site.For example, virtually any of WM's landfill sites in the U.S. and Canada are vulnerable to intermittent drought conditions, flood conditions or both. These significant weather pattern changes can impact the behaviors of materials decaying in a controlled MSW landfill environment. Flooding can impede the collection of landfill gas by filling collection wells with water; drought can reduce the rate of decay of organic material because water is essential to the decay process. Both extreme conditions result in additional labor being required to manage the landfill gas collection system, with additional liquids collection required to respond to excess moisture, and with adjustments to the gas collection system vacuum required to respond to the decrease in gas generation resulting from too little moisture. This can also create roadblocks for the productivity of the landfill gas-to-energy portion of our business.For this analysis, we include those sites that are listed with a ''Highâ€ or ''Extremely Highâ€ Overall Water Risk, as indicated by the WRI Aqueduct Tool.
There are not constraints on our operations related to water use due to our Great Lakes basin and Mississippi River basin operating locations. Therefore, we do not have metrics used to define substantive change to our business, operations, revenue or expenditure from water risk.
Western Digital identifies and assesses water-related risks in multiple ways:  Enterprise risk planning - owned at the Board level for long-term, strategic planning  Business continuity management - owned at the Executive level for protecting against, reducing the likelihood of occurrence, preparing for, responding to and recovering from disruptive incidents  Upstream supply chain management - owned by Global Procurement for continuous real-time monitoring of natural and man-made risks to global suppliers  Downstream supply chain management - owned by Global Quality for monitoring downstream product use by enterprise customers  Energy & resource management - owned by Real Estate Operations for identifying, assessing and reducing water risks related to resource useThrough implementation of these processes, Western Digital business functions regularly assess potential impacts, both internal and external. These may include impacts arising directly or indirectly from water risks and its effects on our direct operations as well as our supply chain, among others. Risks with the potential to materially affect the company would be communicated to the Board of Directors and included in enterprise risk planning activities.
A substantive financial or strategic impact on our business would be an impact that has a considerable or relatively significant effect on our organization at the corporate level, including operational, financial or strategic effects that undermine the entire business or part of a business. Similarly, a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business could occur if any of the key partners or suppliers in our value chain experienced this type of impact.
With over 20 brands, Wyndham Destinations is the world's largest vacation ownership, exchange and rental company. We bring people together and inspire them to discover the world's greatest escapes. We recognize that we put a stress on the water withdrawal due to the nature of our business. We, like our guests, always expect clean, potable water when a faucet is turned on. We recognize that we need to reduce withdrawal in areas that may experience scarcity in the future and we are currently assessing our new footprint to identify and rectify issues in these areas. Loss of water will impact our business model substantially as guests rely on water.
Xilinx consistently reviews the latest technologies while tracking our major data trends from a water management perspective including implementation of the following Water Conservation projects that has significantly helped us reduce the amount of water consumed from a global perspective as shown below.  Weather-based irrigation controls  H2O Utilization Awareness Program  Strategic abandonment of landscape irrigation due to drought conditions  Low-flow fixture retrofits  Adoption of water conservation guidelines for food service operationsAdditionally, Xilinx uses limited water outside of operating our office spaces. Minimal R&D testing is performed at our key operational sites in San Jose and Singapore. Production testing is not conducted at any of our Xilinx offices.Xilinx's risk assessment and opportunity for improvement process covers how climate change factors are identified from the life cycle of our products at an asset level and then rolled into an overall tracking for improvement at the corporate level to set our annual targets and objectives. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is the process by which Xilinx anticipates the effects on the environment of its operational activities. If the likely effects are significant, relevant mitigation measures are taken to reduce or avoid those effects. Life cycle is also considered when determining environmental aspects. To facilitate this, Xilinx has established and implemented a system whereby: â€¢The environmental aspects (e.g. water risks) whether adverse or beneficial, wholly or partially resulting from activities, products and services that are under Xilinx's control and/or influence are identified. â€¢The significance of the environmental impacts is assessed to permit improvement objectives from a Corporate level along with the implementation of necessary control measures at an asset level based on identified prioritization. After identifying the environmental aspects and impacts (e.g. water risks), the significance of these aspects and impacts must be determined. The purpose of evaluating the significance of environmental aspects is to select a group of aspects that will become the focus of the EHS Management System, and for which Xilinx will implement operational controls and/or monitoring and measuring systems. The Site EHS Management Representative, in conjunction with the assessment team, will assign 'significance' to the environmental aspects for approval by the leadership team. Environmental aspects are rated with regard to the: â€¢Severity of associated impacts, â€¢Probability of occurrence, â€¢Potential impact to/of interested parties and â€¢Legal requirements This ranking system is a tool to help prioritize and highlight environmental aspects Xilinx focuses on.
Definition of substantive financial or strategic impact and whether the definition applies to direct operations, or supply chain, or both:Xylem defines a substantive financial impact as anything within our direct operations, supply chain, or value chain that stands to impact 4% or more of Xylem's overall annual revenue.The measure(s), metric(s) or indicator(s) used to identify substantive change, and threshold of change which indicates substantive change:Substantive change is identified through our comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program that has a corporate framework consisting of five key components: (1) Risk Appetite and Strategy, (2) Governance and Organization, (3) Policies and Procedures, (4) Risk Management Process, and (5) Monitoring and Reporting. Our Risk Management Process (4) includes a semi-annual Enterprise Risk Assessment, in which we identify, measure and categorize strategic, operational, financial and reputational risks in the Company and business segments that could impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives and impede our business resilience. Each risk is assigned a ranking of either primary or secondary. Risks are tracked on a Monitoring Dashboard that cascades primary and secondary risks and specifies who owns each risk. The dashboard denotes primary risks as high, moderate or minimal. Primary risks are updated quarterly to add new risks and determine how each primary risk's residual risk has changed (increase, decrease or no change).Every Xylem facility is also responsible for developing and implementing a site-specific Business Continuity Plan, including as elements Crisis Management Plans and IT Disaster Recovery Plans. This process requires sites to evaluate change on a frequent basis and plan for situations that could have a substantive impact to our business. An analysis of water-related risks is included in the local Business Continuity Plans for all Xylem facilities. This proactive procedure helps Xylem to mitigate the risks posed by water, including water scarcity, flood occurrence, biodiversity, regulatory uncertainty and declining water quality.At least one example of substantive impact:A substantive impact within our direct operations would be any disruption to a facility that contributes 4% or more to Xylem's revenue (critical facilities). A substantive impact in our supply chain could be a sole-source supplier that can no longer make a critical part for Xylem's products, reducing our product sales by 4% or more.
The Board maintains overall responsibility for overseeing Yum's risk management, and delegates specific risk-related responsibilities to the Audit Committee and to the Management Planning and Development Committee. The Audit Committee discusses risk management during regular committee meetings and receives risk review reports covering significant areas of risk from senior managers responsible for these functional areas, as well as reports from the General Counsel, Internal Audit. The Audit Committee then provides a summary to the full board.The duties of VP of Global Citizenship and Sustainability include the representation of sustainability issues, such as water, on the Yum! risk committee. This senior level committee is responsible for the evaluation and as appropriate, reporting of possible corporate risk to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for inclusion in our public filings. This committee, which looks at short, medium and long-term risks, prioritizes risks based on a number of factors that impact the business including, but not limited to, financial, operational and reputational factors. More specifically, the size and scope of the potential impact are considered as are the possible duration, and whether the impact is likely to be a one-time occurrence or recurring in nature. We then consider the effect of the risk on business strategy given the risks and opportunities in both the short and long term. Therefore, water related risks, which are embodied at the restaurant and supply chain level, are incorporated into the Company's broader risk management process.For the current reporting cycle, CDP has requested information regarding risks that are substantive at the corporate level and not those at the facility or business unit level. As a global, decentralized, and franchise-focused organization with a diverse supply chain, many risks (such as water) can be important yet not rise to the provided benchmark of being financially or strategically important at a material, substantive level to the corporation. There is no single definition of what would rise to this level but for a corporation such as Yum!, a system impact (including our direct operations, supply chain, or both) of approximately 5% of net income for the annual reporting period could be considered substantive at the corporate level. The definition of what would be considered as substantive for the company is reviewed at least annually and updated as necessary.
